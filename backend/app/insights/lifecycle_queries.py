"""The SQL behind the insight lifecycle (`app.insights.service`).

`insights` is under row-level security, so every statement here runs in a transaction bound to
the project (or with the worker's bypass); the explicit `project_id` filters are a second guard.
Rows are locked and written in fingerprint order, so two transactions applying overlapping
batches wait for each other instead of deadlocking.
