"""Tell a project's insight channels about the critical insights a detector run just opened.

The engine calls `notify_opened` with `ApplyResult.opened`, in the transaction that opened the
insights, so the openings and their outbox rows commit or roll back together. Only a transition
into `open` is passed in, so a re-detection never notifies twice. A warning or info opening
notifies no one. Each insight becomes one `insight.opened` payload, fanned out through the alert
channels' `notify_channels` to every channel in `projects.insight_channel_ids`.
