"""Helpers shared by the stream and output detectors.

`truncated_stream_accepted` and `unsupported_parameter_retried` both look for a fault-injected
span that the client answered with a different request. Both judge client behaviour, so the
fault-injected spans are the evidence, not noise to drop. Both look within one trace: a trace is
one logical request (a lab round), and a new round in the same session after a failure is
correct client behaviour.
