"""Doctor detector: a cut-off stream was treated as a complete answer.

Reads: llm spans of the last hour, fault-injected ones included (it judges client behaviour).
Rule: a span with `gateway.fault_scenario == "truncated_stream"` (F), followed within 5 minutes
in the same trace by a span with a different `request_hash`, and by no later span in that trace
with F's `request_hash`: the client carried on instead of retrying the request or failing.
`rounds` counts such F. One finding per environment, critical.
Guards: needs one round; F must carry a request hash; follow-ups need a known hash.
Evidence: the traces of the rounds, most recent first.
