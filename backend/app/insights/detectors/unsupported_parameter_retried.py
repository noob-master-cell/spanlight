"""Doctor detector: the client drops a rejected parameter and resends.

Reads: llm spans of the last hour, fault-injected ones included (it judges client behaviour).
Rule: a span with `gateway.fault_scenario == "unsupported_parameter"` (F), followed within 60
seconds in the same trace by a span with a different `request_hash`, whatever its status.
`rounds` counts such F. One finding per environment, warning.
Guards: needs one round; F must carry a request hash; follow-ups need a known hash. A 400 with
no follow-up is the correct behaviour and opens nothing.
Evidence: the traces of the rounds, most recent first.
