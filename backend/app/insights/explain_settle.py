"""The last step of an explanation: turn its budget reservation into what the call really cost.

Runs in a session of its own (not the request's, which may be torn down when the client goes
away) and under `shielded`, so cancelling the request does not cancel the settlement. The rules:

* an answer: the reservation becomes the explanation, with the answer and the cost of its usage;
* no answer, but the provider reported usage (it was paid): the row is completed without text
  and with that cost, so the spend stays in the budget; it is never shown; `502 EXPLAIN_FAILED`;
* no answer and no usage, but the request may have been generated (a timeout or connection
  error after it was sent, an answer too large to read, a success without usage): the row is
  completed without text at the reserved worst case; `502 EXPLAIN_FAILED`;
* no answer, no usage, and nothing was generated (the gateway refused the call before sending
  it, or the provider answered with an HTTP error status): the reservation is deleted;
  `502 EXPLAIN_FAILED`;
* the request was cancelled mid-call: whether the provider was paid is unknown, so the row is
  completed without text at the reserved worst case.

Every kept row gets an `insight.explain` audit event. Prompts and answers are never logged.
