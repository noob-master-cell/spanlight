"""Explain with Claude: one insight explained through the gateway, under a monthly budget.

`explain` runs in four steps, and no transaction is open while the provider answers:

1. **Prepare**, in the request's project-bound transaction: the insight, the organization's
   oldest Anthropic credential, the price book, the trace excerpts and the request
   (`app.insights.explain`), and the call's worst-case cost (the prompt's characters ÷ 3 input
   tokens and `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` output tokens). The transaction is then committed, which
   returns its connection to the pool.
2. **Reserve**, in one short transaction under an advisory lock per organization: the
   organization's month-to-date explanation cost (reservations included) plus the worst case
   must not exceed `EXPLAIN_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD`; a reservation row holding the worst case is
   inserted and committed. Two concurrent requests cannot both pass the check on the same sum.
3. **Call** the gateway in process (`key=None`: no cache, faults or key limits) through a route
   built in memory: the one credential, the configured model, one attempt, no fallbacks. The
   trace's environment is `doctor` and its tag `doctor-explain`; the span is written into the
   project like any other call (it is real spend there) and awaited (`DirectSpans`).
4. **Settle** (`app.insights.explain_settle`), shielded from cancellation and in a session of
   its own, so a client that goes away mid-call still leaves a settled row. An answer is stored
   with the cost of its usage. A failure keeps its row, without text and never shown, whenever
   the provider may have billed it: at the reported usage's cost, or at the worst case after a
   timeout, a connection error or a cancellation once the request was sent. Only a call the
   gateway never sent, or one the provider refused with an HTTP error status (no usage),
   releases its reservation.

Prompts and answers are never logged.
