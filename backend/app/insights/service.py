"""The insight lifecycle: apply a detector's findings, and the actions people take on an insight.
Callers commit.

Every call runs in a transaction bound to the project (row-level security), or with the
worker's bypass. `apply_findings` follows this table, for one detector's kind at a time:

| Current status            | Detected again                       | Not detected for 24 h     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| none                      | insert `open`, occurrences 1: opened | -                         |
| `open`, `acknowledged`    | bump occurrences, evidence, copy     | `resolved`                |
| `resolved`                | `open`, bump: opened                 | -                         |
| `muted`, mute running     | bump silently, stays muted           | stays muted               |
| `muted`, mute ended       | `open`, bump, mute cleared: opened   | `resolved`                |

Severity follows the latest detection. Only a transition into `open` is "opened", so a
re-detection never notifies twice. The caller only applies the findings of a detector that ran
without error: a failed run says nothing about whether its problems went away.

The actions each write an audit event: `acknowledge` (`open` only), `resolve` (anything not
resolved; a later detection reopens it), `mute` (any status, until a time in the next 90 days,
with a reason) and `unmute` (`muted` only, back to `open`). An action on a status it does not
apply to is `409 INVALID_TRANSITION`; a bad mute is `422 INVALID_MUTE`; an insight that is not
in the project is `404`. Audit metadata holds the kind, the status before and the mute's end
and reason; insights carry no secrets.
