"""What each kind of insight says: its label, layer, certainty and the copy for a person.

`title` and `summary` are `str.format` templates over `Finding.params`; `render` fills them
and is what `insights` stores. A placeholder a detector did not supply renders as "—". A count
that can be 1 arrives with its noun (`1 burst`, `3 bursts`, see `format.count_noun`), so no
template has to pluralise.
