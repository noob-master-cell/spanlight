"""The LLM gateway: `/gw/v1/*`, called by OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs with a Spanlight gateway key.

The OpenAI SDK uses `base_url="<host>/gw/v1"`; the Anthropic SDK uses `base_url="<host>/gw"`
(it appends `/v1/messages`). A call is checked in this order, and the first check that refuses
answers in the provider envelope of the path (`app.api.gw_errors`):

1. the key, from `Authorization: Bearer spl_gw_…` or `x-api-key: spl_gw_…` (both present with
   different values is refused): parsed, found by its prefix, its secret compared in constant
   time (an unknown prefix still runs a comparison), then its project, route and credentials
   loaded (`UNAUTHORIZED`);
2. the organization ceiling, the key's requests per minute, then its tokens per minute
   (`RATE_LIMITED`); the request's transaction ends here, before any upstream call;
3. the body: at most 10 MB (`PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`), a JSON object with a string `model`
   (`INVALID_REQUEST`);
4. `execute`, which applies the route (model allowlist, budget, cache, faults, retries and
   fallbacks) and answers with the provider's bytes or a gateway error.

A stream is answered as it arrives from the provider. However the response ends (the provider
finished, the client went away, sending failed), the stream is closed in a `finally`, which
closes the provider connection and writes the span. A `truncated_stream` fault ends the
response with a clean end of stream after the last forwarded frame: Starlette has no way to
abort a connection without raising through the server, so the truncation shows as a stream
without its final event (`[DONE]` or `message_stop`), which is what SDKs detect.

None of the dashboard's middleware touches these paths: no cookies, CSRF or Origin check (they
are scoped to `/api/`), and the 1 MiB body limit is `/api/v1` only.
