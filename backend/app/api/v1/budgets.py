"""Budgets: a project's spend caps per project, gateway key, end user or model.

Members list and read budgets (`project:read`); owners and admins create, edit and delete them
(`alerts:write`). Each budget owns a hidden alert rule that measures its spend; the two change
together, and the rule never appears on the alert-rule routes. Responses are built before the
commit, which ends the project binding that row-level security needs.
