"""Provider credentials: the organization's API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic and compatible servers.

Members read the list; only owners add, rotate, check and delete (`credentials:manage`). The
API key is accepted in a request body and never returned: no response, audit event or log line
carries it. Every response that describes a credential is marked uncacheable all the same.

Credential routes take no `Idempotency-Key`: a kept request would have to be compared with the
body that carried the key, and nothing about a credential may be kept outside its sealed column.
