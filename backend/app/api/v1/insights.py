"""The Doctor's insights: list and read them, act on them, and ask Claude to explain one.

Anyone who can read the project reads insights, their explanations and the detector runs
(`project:read`; an API key does not); owners and admins act on them and ask for explanations
(`insights:manage`). Responses are built before the commit, which ends the project binding that
row-level security needs.
