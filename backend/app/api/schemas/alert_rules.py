"""Alerts: a project's alert rules, their events and the rule preview.

The create and edit body, `RuleSpec`, and the preview body, `RuleDefinition`, are owned by the
alerts domain (`app.alerts.rule_spec`), which validates them; they are re-exported here so
routers keep importing from `app.api.schemas`. Metric values and thresholds are decimal strings
without an exponent; an unknown value is `null`, never `"0"`.
