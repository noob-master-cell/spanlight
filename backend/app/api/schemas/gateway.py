"""The LLM gateway: provider credentials, gateway routes and gateway keys.

The create body, `CredentialCreate`, is owned by the gateway domain (`app.gateway.schemas`),
which validates it; it is re-exported here so routers keep importing from `app.api.schemas`.
No response model has a field for the API key: once sent, it is never returned.

A route's `config` is the gateway domain's `RouteConfig` (`app.gateway.route_config`), in
requests and responses alike. A gateway key's create and edit bodies are the domain's
`GatewayKeyCreate` and `GatewayKeyUpdate` (`app.gateway.key_schemas`), re-exported the same way;
only the create response carries the key's `secret`, once.
