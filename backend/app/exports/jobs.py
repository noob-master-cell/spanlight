"""The `create_export` job: stream a project's matching traces to a file in object storage.

The job reads under the project's row-level security, never with the bypass flag: the project id
in the payload is bound to every transaction it opens, so even a wrong filter cannot reach
another project's rows. Transaction-local settings end with each transaction, so every database
step opens its own short session and binds the project first. Reads also run under a statement
timeout, so one runaway query ends the export (`EXPORT_TIMEOUT`) instead of hanging it.

Memory stays flat. Traces are read in keyset batches, each trace is encoded to its own chunk and
handed to the store's streaming upload, and the upload sends 8 MiB parts as they fill. A JSONL
batch holds at most `MAX_SPANS_PER_BATCH` spans (summed over its traces), and a trace with more
spans than that has them read in keyset chunks, so nothing holds a whole export or a whole
oversized trace.

The job runs in the worker's long-job slot, which leaves the lease to the task: a background beat
extends it every 20 s for as long as the work runs, so a single slow statement cannot let the job
be taken over, and a lease that is lost cancels the work.
