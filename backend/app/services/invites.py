"""Mailing an invite: the email, and the limit that keeps it from being abused.

The route in `app.api.v1.orgs` creates the invite; the rules for sending it live here. Sign-up is
open, so anyone can create an org and invite arbitrary addresses. Without a limit, strangers could
send mail from our domain, so mailed invites are counted per org and per inviting user. The user
limit holds across orgs: without it, creating many orgs would multiply the per-org budget.
