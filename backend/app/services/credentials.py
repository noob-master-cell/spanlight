"""Replacing a password, and signing in against it, without a session outliving the change.

Signing in and replacing a password can race. A sign-in verifies the old password (argon2 takes
tens of milliseconds), a reset commits meanwhile and deletes every session, and then the sign-in
inserts its own: a session that survives a password that no longer exists. A set-based DELETE
only removes the rows committed when it runs, so the DELETE alone cannot close that window.

The user row is where the two sides meet, and both take its lock in the same order:

* `replace_password` writes the new hash first (an UPDATE, which locks the row until commit) and
  only then deletes the sessions.
* A sign-in calls `lock_user_for_sign_in` after the slow verification and before creating its
  session. That reads the row `FOR SHARE`, which holds it until the sign-in commits.

So whichever gets the row first, the other has to wait for it. If the reset is first, the
sign-in waits for its commit, sees the new hash and is refused. If the sign-in is first, the
reset's UPDATE waits for the sign-in's commit, and the DELETE that follows sees (and removes)
the session it created. The slow hashing happens outside the lock on both sides, so the lock
is held for a few statements.

The same locked read also answers whether two-factor authentication is on, so a sign-in decides
whether to ask for the second step from the row it holds, not from the copy it read before the
slow verification. Turning it on is an UPDATE of that row, so it either committed before the lock
(and is seen) or waits for the sign-in to commit.
