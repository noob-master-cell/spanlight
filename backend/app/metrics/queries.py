"""Raw-span reads behind the metrics endpoints, for windows of 24 hours or less.

Every statement has two forms, picked by whether an environment filter was given:

* Without a filter it reads ``spans`` alone. Every span has its trace (the composite foreign key
  guarantees it), so joining ``traces`` would neither add nor drop a row; it would only make the
  database read the whole of ``traces`` for the project, which at tens of millions of spans is
  the slowest part of the request.
* With a filter it joins ``traces``, because the environment belongs to the trace.

Both forms return the same rows for the same data. The filter-free form reads only the columns
that ``spans_project_started_cov_idx`` carries, so it is answered from the index without touching
the table (see migration 0016). Keep the two in step: a new column read here belongs in the index.

The queries run in the caller's session and rely on its project binding for row-level security;
the explicit ``project_id`` filter is a second guard, not the only one.
