"""Raw reads behind release comparison.

A release belongs to the trace. Every read starts from the project's traces that started inside
the window and carry a release (`traces_project_release_started_idx`), then joins their spans, so
a trace counts for the window it started in and all of its spans count with it.

The span side of each join is bounded below by the window start. That changes no result (a
trace starts when its first span does, so none of its spans starts earlier), but it lets the
planner read the spans through the covering index `spans_project_started_cov_idx` by range
instead of probing the primary key once per trace. The upper side stays open: a span of a trace
that started before the window ends may start after it.

Compare reads take both releases at once (`release IN (:a, :b)`) and return one row per release
and group.

The queries run in the caller's session and rely on its project binding for row-level security;
the explicit `project_id` filter is a second guard, not the only one.
