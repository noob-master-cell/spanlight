"""Latency histogram buckets for hourly rollups.

A rollup row cannot keep every duration, so it keeps a fixed-size histogram
instead: 32 buckets whose upper bounds grow geometrically from 1 ms to
300 000 ms (300 s). Each bound is about 1.5x the previous one. Two histograms
for the same dimensions add element-wise, so any number of hours can be merged
into one without going back to the raw spans.

Percentiles read from a histogram are an approximation. Everything that falls
into a bucket is assumed to be spread evenly across it, and the answer is
interpolated linearly between the bucket's edges. Because a bucket is about
1.5x wide, the estimate is within roughly 25 % of the true value, which is
enough for a dashboard chart over days or weeks and is why those responses are
labelled approximate. Windows of 24 hours or less read the raw spans and stay
exact.

Bucket ``i`` holds the durations ``d`` with ``BOUNDS_MS[i-1] < d <= BOUNDS_MS[i]``
(bucket 0 holds everything up to and including ``BOUNDS_MS[0]``). The last
bucket also holds every duration above ``BOUNDS_MS[-1]``, so it is open-ended
and its percentile estimates are clamped to ``BOUNDS_MS[-1]``.

The rollup job computes the bucket index in SQL, so the SQL and
:func:`bucket_index` must agree on every value: the index is the number of
bounds strictly less than the duration, capped at ``BUCKET_COUNT - 1``. The
SQL must take its bounds from :data:`BOUNDS_MS` (as a bound parameter, negated
and reversed for ``width_bucket``; see ``app.rollups.compute``) instead of
recomputing them, so the two cannot drift apart.

This module is pure: no I/O, no settings, no database.
