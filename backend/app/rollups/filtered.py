"""Read the hourly span rollups with dimension filters, for alert rules and budgets.

``read_rollups`` (``app.rollups.queries``) serves the metrics endpoints, which only filter by
environment and never need time to first token. Alert metrics also filter by provider and model
and estimate a TTFT percentile, so they read through :func:`read_filtered_rollups` instead. The
definitions are the same as there:

* ``llm_calls``, ``llm_errors``, ``unpriced`` and both histograms come from rows of kind ``llm``.
* ``spans``, ``cost_usd`` and token totals come from rows of every kind. A cost is ``None`` when
  every contributing row is unpriced, never ``0``; ``spans`` tells "no spans" from "unpriced".
* Each filter matches its dimension exactly (``model`` also matches a snapshot of the name, see
  ``app.core.model_match``), so rows with an unknown (NULL) value only appear
  when that filter is not given. ``environment`` is the trace's environment.

The window covers the hours whose ``bucket_start`` lies in ``[floor_hour(start), end)``, so a
window edge inside an hour reads that hour in full.

The query runs in the caller's session and relies on its project binding for row-level
security; the explicit ``project_id`` filter is a second guard, not the only one.
