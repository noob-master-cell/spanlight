"""The ``rollup_hourly`` job: keep the hourly rollups current.

Every run does two things, in this order:

1. It recomputes the last 48 hours for each project that has spans in that window, so a span
   that arrives late, or is sent again with other attributes, is reflected within one run.
2. It backfills history. A project whose oldest span inside its retention (capped at 90 days)
   is older than its oldest rollup hour has a gap, and the job fills ``[oldest span hour,
   oldest rollup hour)`` in daily chunks, newest first. Because the gap is read from the data,
   a backfill that was cut short (the task has a hard timeout) simply continues on the next run.

The recompute comes first so a slow backfill never delays current data, and the backfill stops
starting new chunks after ``BACKFILL_BUDGET_SECONDS`` so the run ends inside the task timeout.
Projects with a gap are served smallest gap first: a small project is finished in one run and
a large one cannot starve the others, while the large one still advances with every run
because the budget it gets is whatever the smaller ones left over.

Spans older than 48 hours are not revisited except at the old end of that gap. A span that
arrives later than that, in the middle of the history, is missing from the rollups until
someone runs ``spanlight rollups backfill`` for its hours.
