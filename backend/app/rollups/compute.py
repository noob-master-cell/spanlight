"""Recompute hourly rollups from the raw spans and traces.

The rollup tables are derived data. :func:`compute_rollups` rebuilds every row of a project in an
hour-aligned range: it deletes the existing rows in that range and inserts fresh aggregates
computed from the raw rows. Delete-then-insert (instead of an upsert) is deliberate: a span that
is sent again with another model or environment moves to a different group, and an upsert would
leave the old group's row behind with counts that no longer exist.

The aggregates use the same definitions as the raw metrics queries in ``app.api.v1.metrics``, so
a rollup and a raw read of the same hours agree:

* ``span_count`` counts every span of the row's kind; ``errors`` counts spans with status
  ``error``. The reader filters ``kind = 'llm'`` to get ``llm_calls`` and the error rate.
* ``unpriced_calls`` counts ``llm`` spans whose ``cost_usd`` is NULL. It is 0 for other kinds.
* Token columns sum the span columns, treating unknown as 0. ``cost_usd`` sums the known costs
  and stays NULL when no span in the row has one, so an unpriced row is never reported as free.
* ``environment`` is the environment of the span's trace. Spans are bucketed by their
  ``started_at`` and traces by theirs.
* ``errored_traces`` counts traces whose ``error_count`` is above 0, which is the rule the trace
  list uses for ``status=error``.
