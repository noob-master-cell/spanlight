"""Time-based one-time passwords (RFC 6238) and recovery codes, as pure functions.

No database, no settings and no clock of its own: time is always passed in, so everything here is
deterministic under test. The rules around them (who may enable, when a code is spent) are in
`app.auth.totp_service`.

The parameters are the ones every authenticator app assumes: HMAC-SHA1, six digits, 30-second
steps. A code is accepted for the current step and one step either side, to forgive a phone clock
that is a few seconds off, and only if its step is later than the last one used (see
`match_step`).
