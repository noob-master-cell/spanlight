"""Single-use tokens for links sent by email (verify an address, reset a password).

The raw token is 32 random bytes in URL-safe base64. It travels in the emailed link, and only
its SHA-256 is stored in `email_tokens`, so reading that table cannot be turned into working
links. The raw link does exist in one other place: the body of the queued email in
`notification_outbox`. It stays there until the delivery job settles the row (sent, or failed for
good) and reduces the payload to its subject, so a database read can recover a working link
only while its email is still waiting to be delivered.
