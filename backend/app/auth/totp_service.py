"""Two-factor authentication for one user: set up, enable, check a code, disable.

The arithmetic is in `app.auth.totp`; this module decides what may happen to the database rows.
Callers commit. Two rules matter more than the rest:

* **A code is spent once.** `verify` reads the user `FOR UPDATE`, so two sign-ins presenting one
  code are serialised: the first moves `totp_last_step` forward, the second finds the code's step
  no longer ahead of it and is refused. Without the lock both would read the old step and both
  would be let in.
* **A secret that cannot be read fails closed.** If the seed cannot be opened (the keyring lost
  its key, `CREDENTIALS_KEYS` was removed), `verify` raises instead of returning False or True.
  Treating it as "no second factor" would let anyone with the password past it; the caller turns
  the error into a response. Recovery codes need no key and still work.

Nothing here logs a secret, a code or a recovery code, and none is ever put in an exception
message.
