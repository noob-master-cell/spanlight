"""What a provider profile is allowed to do: sign someone in, create an account, link, unlink.

The rules, in the order they are applied to a sign-in:

1. An identity with this `(provider, subject)` exists: it is that user. The subject is the
   provider's stable id; the email is not consulted, so a changed address cannot move an
   identity to another account.
2. Otherwise, if a user has the same email:
   * the provider does not vouch for the email: refused, nothing linked;
   * the local account never proved the email: refused, nothing linked;
   * both vouch for it: the identity is linked to that user.
3. Otherwise, if the provider vouches for the email, a new user is created. An email the
   provider does not vouch for never creates an account: GitHub lets anyone add any address to
   their account unverified, and an account created for it would hold that GitHub identity after
   the real owner of the address recovered the account.

"Vouch" always means the provider's verified flag, never the bare presence of an address.

Callers commit. Nothing here sets cookies or builds redirects.
