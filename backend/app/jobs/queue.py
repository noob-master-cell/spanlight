"""A lease-based job queue in Postgres.

Claiming a job takes a time-limited lease and increments its `fence`. Every
later state change (complete, fail, extend) is conditional on the fence the
worker received, so a worker whose lease expired and whose job was re-claimed
by another worker can no longer change it: its writes match zero rows.

`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` lets many workers poll concurrently without blocking
on each other's candidate rows.
