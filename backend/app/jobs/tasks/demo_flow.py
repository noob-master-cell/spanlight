"""The support-bot flow the demo job runs: classify, look up an FAQ entry, answer.

Its two LLM calls go through the gateway (`execute`) with the trace headers of the trace the flow
started, so the gateway's `llm` spans land in it, under the root span. Each call's span is
written before the flow goes on (`DirectSpans`, not the background recorder): the job's monthly
cap counts the costs on stored spans, so a paid call whose span could not be stored ends the flow
with `DemoSpendUnrecordedError` and no further provider call. The flow collects the spans it
writes itself, the root `chain` span and the `faq-lookup` retrieval span, for the job to ingest.
