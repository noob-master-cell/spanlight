"""The ingestion pipeline: validate → normalize → upsert → recompute rollups.

Validation and normalization are here; the writes are `app.ingest.store`.

Idempotent by construction: spans are upserted on their primary key and every
trace rollup is recomputed from the stored spans, so replaying a batch (SDK
retries, OTLP re-export) leaves exactly the same rows behind.

Concurrency: the trace upsert takes a row lock on each affected trace, so two
batches touching the same trace serialize; rows are written in sorted key
order so batches touching several traces cannot deadlock each other.
