"""The single source of truth for what each membership role may do.

Roles are cumulative: each role holds every permission of the roles below it.
Route handlers never compare roles directly; they declare the permission they
need via `app.api.deps.require(...)` and, for finer decisions, call `has()`.

Each permission is also classed `read` or `write` (`permission_class`). A personal access token
with the `read` scope is limited to the `read` ones whatever its user's role allows.
