    Cookies are an ambient credential: a browser attaches them to requests another site caused,
    which is why cookie-authenticated requests need CSRF protection. A bearer credential is not:
    only the code holding it can send it. So when a bearer is present on an `/api` request the
    `Cookie` header is dropped before routing. Nothing downstream can then read a session or
    CSRF cookie by mistake, and the API never falls back to the cookie when the bearer is wrong.
    `OriginCheckMiddleware` exempts the same requests.

    Only the Bearer scheme counts. Browsers attach Basic and Negotiate credentials by
    themselves when a proxy in front of the app asks for them, so those are ambient too: such a
    request keeps its cookies and its Origin check.

    The scope is changed in place rather than copied: the router records the matched route in
    the scope it is given, and the request-context middleware reads it back from its own.

    Requests without an Origin header are rejected too: every browser sends it
    on unsafe methods, so its absence means a non-browser client, which should
    send `Authorization: Bearer …` instead.

    A request with a bearer is exempt. CSRF abuses credentials the browser attaches by itself,
    and this API never reads cookies on such a request (`BearerRequestMiddleware`), and every
    `/api/v1` route answers a bearer with an authentication result or a refusal, never with
    anonymous service. A page on another site cannot add the header either: it is not one a
