"""Reading a request body with a size bound, for routes that read their body themselves.

Ingestion (`/v1/traces`, `/v1/otlp/traces`) and the gateway (`/gw/v1/*`) take bodies larger
than the dashboard's 1 MiB and parse them on their own, so they read through here. The bound
is checked twice before anything is buffered past it: a declared `Content-Length` over the
limit is refused without reading, and a chunked or lying body is cut off as soon as the running
total passes the limit. A gzip or deflate body is decompressed with the same bound applied to
the decompressed size, which defuses decompression bombs.

The failures are plain exceptions, so each caller answers in its own error format
(problem+json for ingestion, the provider's envelope for the gateway).
