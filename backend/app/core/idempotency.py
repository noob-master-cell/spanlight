"""Idempotency keys: a retried POST runs once and is answered with the first answer.

A route opts in by wrapping its authorization dependency: `Depends(idempotent(require(...)))`. A
client that sends an `Idempotency-Key` header (at most 128 visible ASCII characters) gets this:

* The first request runs. Its status, JSON body and content type are stored for 24 hours,
  whatever the status, except a 5xx: then the key is released so the retry can run.
* The same key with the same request (method, path and canonical body) after that is answered
  with the stored response and `Idempotent-Replayed: true`, and the route does not run again.
* The same key with a different request is 422 `IDEMPOTENCY_MISMATCH`.
* The same key while the first request is still running is 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_IN_PROGRESS`, unless
  that request has been silent for over a minute: it is then taken to have died and is replaced.

A key belongs to one principal (`principal_key`), so two people can use the same key. Without the
header the dependency does nothing but authorize.

Using it on a route::

    @router.post("/projects/{project_id}/things", status_code=202)
    async def create_thing(
        access: Annotated[Access, Depends(idempotent(require(Permission.X)))],
        body: ThingIn,
    ) -> ThingOut: ...

`idempotent(authorize)` runs `authorize` as its own dependency and hands its result to the route,
so a request is always authorized before a key is reserved, and a replay is authorized exactly like
the request it replays: a caller who lost access since gets the 403 or 404, not the stored answer.
Do not declare `authorize` on the route as well; FastAPI would run it twice.

How it works, and why in two parts. Reserving the key has to happen after the caller has been
authenticated and before the handler runs, so it is a dependency, which can also short-circuit a
replay by raising `IdempotentReplay`. Storing the answer needs the response as the client receives
it, including errors that exception handlers turn into responses, and no dependency or route class
sees that. `IdempotencyMiddleware` sits just outside the exception handlers: once the dependency
has reserved a key it holds the response back until its last chunk, stores it (or releases the key
on a 5xx, a crash or an answer it cannot keep), and only then lets it go, so a client that retries
the moment it has an answer always finds one. A request that did not reserve a key, which is every
request without the header, passes through untouched.

The answer must be JSON and under 1 MiB, as it is kept in a `jsonb` column. The middleware decides
when the response starts or as soon as it grows too large: anything else (a 5xx, another content
type, a file) is released and passed on without being held. Only the status, body and content type
are replayed, not other headers. The answer is kept as plain text in the database for a day, so a
route whose answer carries a secret that is shown once (a new API key, a new token) must not use
this.

The store uses its own small connection pool (`app.state.idempotency_session_factory`): it takes a
connection while the request still holds one from the main pool.
