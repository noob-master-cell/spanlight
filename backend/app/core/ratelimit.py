"""Token-bucket rate limiting shared by every API replica.

A bucket is one row of `rate_limit_buckets`. Taking a token is a single statement, so replicas
never disagree about how many are left, and nothing is kept in process memory.

Two decisions shape the rest of the module:

* **A token is taken on a connection of its own, in its own transaction.** If it were taken on the
  request's session, the row lock would be held until the request committed, which would
  serialise every concurrent request of one key behind the slowest of them, and a request that
  rolled back would hand its token back. A separate short transaction releases the lock as soon
  as the statement is done and makes a spent token stay spent. The connections come from a small
  pool of their own (see `create_app`) because the request still holds one from the main pool.
* **The database clock is the only clock.** Replicas with skewed clocks must not refill a bucket
  at different speeds.

If the database cannot be reached, `enforce_rate_limit` lets the request through and logs a
warning (at most once a minute per scope) and counts the skip in
`spanlight_rate_limit_unavailable_total`: a limiter that is down must not take the API down with it.

# One statement, in two parts.
#
# `taken` is the upsert. A key seen for the first time is inserted with a full bucket minus the
# token being taken. A key that exists is updated to its refilled count minus one, but only
# `WHERE` that count is at least one; otherwise the row is left untouched and the upsert returns
# nothing. Postgres serialises concurrent upserts of one key on the row lock and re-evaluates the
# `SET` and the `WHERE` against the row as the previous holder left it, and inserts that race on
# a new key are arbitrated by the primary key, so two requests can never take the same token.
# `updated_at` only moves forward. A refused request writes nothing, so the refill keeps counting
# from the last write.
#
# The outer SELECT reports the result: `allowed` is whether the upsert took a token, and
# `retry_after` is how long until a bucket in the state this statement started from holds one
# (read from the statement's snapshot, so under contention it can lag the locked row by a few
# milliseconds; it is a hint for the client, not part of the decision).
# The f-string only splices in the constant above; every value is a bound parameter.
