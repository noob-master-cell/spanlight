"""Self-tracing: the api and the worker export OpenTelemetry spans about themselves.

Off unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set. With it set, the api traces its HTTP requests
(FastAPI), database queries (SQLAlchemy) and outbound calls (httpx); the worker traces the last two.
The endpoint can be any OTLP HTTP collector, including a Spanlight instance's own
`/v1/otlp/traces`, which is why ingestion, health and metrics requests are never traced: an
instance tracing into itself would otherwise create a span for every batch of spans it receives.

What is recorded is deliberately narrow:

- Request bodies and headers are not captured. The instrumentations only capture headers when
  asked to, and nothing here asks, but the FastAPI one also reads the
  `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_CAPTURE_HEADERS_*` environment variables (an empty list in code
  falls back to them). So `SanitizingSpanExporter` removes every `http.request.header.*` and
  `http.response.header.*` attribute, and setting those variables cannot put an `Authorization`
  or `Cookie` header on a span.
- URLs are recorded without their query string, which can hold bearer secrets (an invite
  `?token=`, an OAuth callback's `code` and `state`). The instrumentations put it on the spans
  themselves (`http.url`, `url.full`, `http.target`, `url.query`), so `SanitizingSpanExporter`
  removes it from every span just before export.
- Server spans carry no information about the client or the `Host` the client chose: client
  address and port, user agent, peer and host attributes are removed by the same exporter.
- Error text is replaced by the exception class name. SQLAlchemy puts the database error's
  message in the span status and FastAPI records exception messages, and a Postgres message can
  quote row values (`Key (email)=(a@b.com) already exists`). Exception stack traces are dropped.
- SQL spans carry the statement text, which holds bind placeholders and never the parameter
  values: the instrumentation does not read them, and sqlcommenter is left off.
- Request spans carry `spanlight.request_id` and `spanlight.principal_kind` (session, pat, api_key
  or anonymous), never an id, email or credential.
