"""How a configured model name matches the model a span or a request carries.

One rule everywhere (prices, alert and budget filters, the budget guard): the names are equal, or
the actual name is the configured one followed by a snapshot suffix, `-YYYYMMDD`, `-YYYY-MM-DD`
or `-latest`. So `gpt-4o` matches `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` but `gpt-4.1` does not match
`gpt-4.1-nano`. This module holds the Python predicate and the SQL for filtering a column by a
configured name; the budget guard builds the opposite direction (the configured name in a
column) next to its own query.
