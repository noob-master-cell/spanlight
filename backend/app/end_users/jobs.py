"""The `refresh_user_stats` job: recompute yesterday's and today's per-user stats, every 15 minutes.

One query, with row-level security bypassed, lists the projects that have a user-tagged trace since
the start of yesterday (UTC); each then refreshes in a session of its own, bound to it alone.
Yesterday is recomputed as well as today so a trace that arrives late for the day that just ended
is absorbed.

The job has a single attempt: the next pass is the retry. A pass stops starting projects after
`RUN_BUDGET_SECONDS` so it ends inside the worker's task timeout, and each project runs under its
own time bound so one slow project cannot hold the pass until the worker kills it. A project that
fails or runs out of time is logged and the pass goes on with the others.

Projects go stalest first: the worker process remembers when it last attempted each project, and
a project it has not attempted yet leads. A project a pass did not reach, or one that failed, is
therefore ahead of every project refreshed after it on the next pass. The memory is per process
and starts empty, so after a restart (or on another worker) the order is the query's, with every
project equal; no project waits behind the same tail pass after pass.
