"""Recompute the per-user daily stats of a project from its raw traces and spans.

A trace counts for the UTC day it started and an end user is the trace's `external_user_id`.
The figures of a trace are those of its LLM spans, whatever day they started: `llm_calls` and
`errors` count them (an error is a span with status `error`), `unpriced_calls` counts those
without a cost, `tokens` adds input and output
tokens (input already includes the cached ones) and `cost_usd` sums the priced ones, `NULL` when
the user's day has no priced call.

The recompute is idempotent. Rows of the range are upserted on their natural key, and rows of
the range no trace backs any more (a trace retention removed, say) are deleted, so the table
never keeps a stale day. The statement runs in the caller's session, which must be bound to the
project (row-level security); the caller commits.
