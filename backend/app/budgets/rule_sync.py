"""The hidden alert rule a budget owns, kept in step with the budget.

A budget is evaluated by an `alert_rules` row of kind `budget`: metric `spend`, comparator `gt`,
the budget's amount as the threshold, no window (the evaluation job reads the budget's period
instead), no cooldown, the budget's scope as the filter, and the budget's name, channels and
enabled flag. People never edit it directly: the rules API treats it as missing. The budget
service writes the budget and its rule in one transaction, through these helpers.
