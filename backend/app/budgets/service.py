"""Budgets: create, edit and delete a budget together with the hidden rule that evaluates it.
Callers commit.

Every write runs in a transaction bound to the project (row-level security) and takes the
project's write lock first (`lock_project_for_write`, through the router), then the budget's rule
and the budget (`queries.lock_budget`). The project lock conflicts with itself, so two creates in
one project run one after the other and cannot both pass the budget limit.

A budget and its rule always change in the same transaction. An edit that changes what a firing
budget measures or caps (amount, scope, period) or disables it resolves the alert first and
sends `alert.resolved`, as for rules; a new scope or period also drops the rule's last measured
spend, which belonged to the old one, so the budget shows no spend until the next evaluation.

Audit metadata holds the budget's name, scope kind, period and action and the names of the
fields that changed; never `scope_id`, which can be an end user's identifier.
