"""One upstream attempt: send the request, read what comes back, name how it ended.

How an attempt can end, and what the client gets when it is the last one:

- a 2xx response: the answer (with an around fault applied, when one was decided);
- a 4xx or 5xx response: that response, byte for byte;
- a 3xx response: `UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE` (redirect variant), never retried;
- a timeout: `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`; a connection error: `UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE`;
- a private or local address, or `http://` where it is not allowed: `UPSTREAM_BLOCKED`, never
  retried or fallen back from (the configuration is wrong, not the provider);
- an answer over `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`: `UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE`, never retried.

A non-streaming answer is read whole here, and a stream's first chunk is awaited here, both
within what is left of the route's budget. Whatever else interrupts the attempt (a cancellation,
an unexpected error) closes the provider response before it propagates, so no pooled
connection is left open.
