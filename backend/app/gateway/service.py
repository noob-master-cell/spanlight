"""Provider credentials: add, rotate, delete and check them. Callers commit.

Resealing them under a new key is `app.gateway.reseal`. Every write takes the organization's
key-share lock first (`lock_org_for_write`), then the credential row, then writes the audit
event: the lock order of `app.services.deletion`, so a concurrent organization deletion waits
instead of deadlocking.

The clear API key lives only in the request body and in the local variables of these functions.
It is never stored, logged, audited or put in an exception: the audit metadata names the
credential, and log lines carry its id.
