"""A gateway route's configuration: its targets, retry and fallback policies and time budget.

Pure: no database, no I/O. Stored as JSON in `gateway_routes.config` and in each row of
`gateway_route_versions`. Validated with these models when it is saved: unknown fields are
rejected everywhere, so a misspelt key is a `422`, never a setting that silently does nothing,
and integers are strict: `true` or `2.0` is not a count. A stored config is read back with
`load_stored`, which trusts what was validated on the way in and does not apply today's bounds
again, so a rule tightened later never makes an existing route unreadable.

What these models cannot check is that each target's credential belongs to the route's
organization; the route service does that against the database.
