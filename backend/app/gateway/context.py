"""The values one gateway call is made of: what was asked, who asks, and what came back.

Pure data. `GatewayRequest` is the client's call, `GatewayContext` everything the gateway knows
about the caller and the services it uses, `GatewayResult` what `execute` hands back to its
caller. The trace a call joins comes from `app.gateway.trace_headers`.

`key=None` on a context means an in-process caller (the demo job, later explanations and the
playground): no rate limits, cache or faults, and the environment comes from the context.
