"""Injecting a decided fault (`app.gateway.faults`) into one gateway call.

Two entry points, matching where a scenario acts:

- `apply_before` runs instead of the provider call. It returns the provider-shaped
  `GatewayError` to answer with (after holding the call, for `timeout`), or `None` when the
  scenario acts around the call instead.
- `apply_around` wraps the provider's real response. It returns a response whose body is cut
  (`malformed_json`), stopped early (`truncated_stream`) or delayed (`slow_response`); any
  other scenario returns the response unchanged.

Fault errors copy each provider's wording, so client code is exercised against realistic
bodies, and carry `spanlight_code` / `X-Spanlight-Code` `FAULT_<SCENARIO>` plus the
`X-Spanlight-Fault: <scenario>` header. Waiting goes through the injected `sleep`, so tests run
on a fake clock.
