"""Budget guard protocol: decide before any upstream call whether a request may proceed.

Pure protocol and value types. ``execute`` calls the guard once per request, after the model
is resolved and before the cache and the attempt loop. A blocked decision becomes a
``BUDGET_EXCEEDED`` error with zero attempts and no upstream call. ``execute`` records
``spanlight.budget.blocked=true`` and ``spanlight.budget.id`` on the error span. Phase 2 ships
only the no-op guard; Phase 3 supplies the real ``budgets`` implementation.
