"""The usage chunk the gateway asks OpenAI for on a streaming chat completion, and hiding it.

Without `stream_options.include_usage` OpenAI sends no usage on a stream, and the call's span
would have no tokens or cost. So when the client set no `stream_options`, the gateway asks for
usage itself (`injects_usage`). OpenAI then ends the stream with one extra chunk whose `choices`
is empty and which carries `usage`. A client that never asked for it may not expect it (code
written as `chunk.choices[0].delta` raises on it), so `UsageChunkFilter` drops that chunk from
the client's stream while the observer still reads it. A client that asked for usage itself
gets the stream unchanged.

Pure: bytes in, bytes out.
