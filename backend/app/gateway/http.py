"""The one HTTP client that all upstream (LLM provider) traffic goes through.

`build_http_client` returns an `httpx.AsyncClient` that never follows redirects, sets no default
timeout (each call passes its own) and ignores the environment apart from the CA bundle variables
(`SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`): no proxy variables, which would send traffic to a host the
egress check never saw, and no `.netrc`, which could add an `Authorization` header of its own.
It keeps no cookies: the client is shared by every organization, so a cookie one provider set
during one organization's call (Cloudflare sets them on `.openai.com` and `.anthropic.com`)
would otherwise ride on the next organization's calls. It holds a pool of 100 HTTP/1.1
connections.

Two transports sit under it, both in `app.core.egress_http` (shared with the alert channels'
client): `VettedTransport`, the real network through a pool that only connects to vetted
addresses, and `EgressPolicyTransport`, which refuses `http://` unless
`GATEWAY_ALLOW_INSECURE_BASE_URLS` is on and, around an injected test transport, runs the address
check before the request instead.
