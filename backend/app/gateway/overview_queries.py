"""Raw-span reads behind the gateway overview. Nothing here writes.

The overview reads the spans a gateway key produced, never the whole project: every statement
filters `source_key_id IS NOT NULL`, which is the predicate of the partial index
`spans_project_gateway_started_idx` on `(project_id, started_at)` (migration 0202), so the
window is a range scan of that index and natively ingested spans are not visited. The window is
at most `MAX_OVERVIEW_WINDOW`, which keeps the read bounded by the gateway traffic of those days.

The gateway writes what the overview needs as span attributes (`app.gateway.tracing`), so the
numbers are read from `attributes` with a type check: a missing or non-numeric value is NULL and
does not count, never 0. Time to first token and the duration are span columns.

An `environment` filter applies to the trace the span belongs to, as for the metrics overview.
Each statement is written twice, without and with that join, and both return the same rows for
the same data. The queries run in the caller's session and rely on its project binding for
row-level security; the explicit `project_id` filter is a second guard, not the only one.
`provider_credentials` has no row-level security: the `org_id` condition is its boundary.
