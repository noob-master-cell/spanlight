"""The routing plan: which targets can serve a call, in what order, and what to do after a failure.

Pure: no database, no I/O, no clock. The caller owns the attempt loop and the time budget; this
module only answers "which target next" and "retry, fall back or give up". Retries and fallbacks
happen only before the first byte reaches the client, which is the caller's concern too.
