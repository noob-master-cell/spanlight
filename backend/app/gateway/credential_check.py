"""Checking a provider credential: list the provider's models with it and report the outcome.

The request is the adapter's `check_request`, sent through the gateway's upstream client, so a
check takes the path every gateway call takes: the same headers, the egress check when the
connection is opened, no redirects. The outcome is a short status line (`401 Unauthorized`,
`timeout`), never the provider's response body: a body can echo request headers, and so the key.
