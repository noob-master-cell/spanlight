"""`execute`: one gateway call, from the checked request to the answer and its span.

Every gateway caller goes through here: the `/gw/v1` router with a key, and in-process callers
(the demo job, later explanations and the playground) with `key=None`. The checks run in this
order, and the first that answers ends the call:

1. the requested model against the key's `allowed_models`, before any alias is applied
   (`MODEL_NOT_ALLOWED`), then the route's targets that serve the surface
   (`NO_COMPATIBLE_TARGET`), ordered by a weighted first pick;
2. the budget guard (`BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, no upstream call);
3. the cache, for a non-streaming call with a key that has a TTL (a hit replays the answer);
4. the fault decision, for a key with a fault profile (a "before" fault answers instead of the
   provider);
5. the attempt loop (`attempts.run_attempts`): retries and fallbacks inside `timeout_ms`;
6. the cache store, for a provider's 200.

Each call becomes exactly one `llm` span (`tracing.build_span`), written in the background by
`recorder.record_soon` (or handed to the context's `span_sink`): right away for a complete
answer, and for a stream once it ends or the client goes away. A stream is returned when its
first upstream byte has arrived. The overhead and time to first token count from
`GatewayRequest.received` when the router set it, and from the start of `execute` otherwise.
