"""Forwarding a provider's stream to the client, then writing the call's span.

`forward_stream` yields the upstream bytes unchanged while the surface's observer reads copies
(usage, model, finish reason, the reassembled output). The one exception is the usage-only chunk
of a chat completion stream when the gateway, not the client, asked for it: the observer reads
it and the client never sees it (`app.gateway.usage_chunk`).

The span is written once the stream ends, whichever way it ends (`GatewayStream` also covers a
stream nobody started reading):

- the provider finished: a normal span;
- the provider went quiet for the idle timeout or its connection broke: an error span with the
  reason, and the client's stream simply ends;
- the client went away (the generator is closed or cancelled): an error span saying after how
  long, with `spanlight.gateway.client_disconnected` true.

The span is written by a background task, so it survives the cancellation of the request.
