"""Everything the gateway needs to serve a call made with a key, read before any check runs.

Call order, all in the request's transaction:

1. `parse_key(presented, GATEWAY_KEY_PREFIX)`; a `None` is `UNAUTHORIZED`.
2. `find_key(db, parsed.prefix)`; a `None` (unknown or revoked) is `UNAUTHORIZED`.
3. `key_secret_matches(parsed.secret, key.secret_hash)`; a mismatch is `UNAUTHORIZED`.
4. `load_key_context(db, key)`; a `None` (the route or project went away) is `UNAUTHORIZED`.

So nothing about the key's project is read, and no project is bound, until the presented
secret has been checked.

The key is found by its prefix before its project is known. `gateway_keys` is under row-level
security and request code never sets the bypass flag, so `find_key` goes through the read-only
policy that migration 0202 adds: with the transaction-local setting `app.gateway_key_prefix`
set to the presented prefix, exactly that one row is visible. The setting is cleared as soon as
the row is read. `load_key_context` then binds the key's project for the rest of the
transaction, so everything after it sees that project's rows and nothing else.
