"""What every provider adapter shares: the request and response types and the header rules.

An adapter turns a gateway request (surface, JSON body, the client's headers, the provider key)
into the provider's HTTP request, and sends it through the upstream client from
`app.gateway.http`. Bodies go upstream as the JSON they arrived as and come back byte for byte.

Header rules, both ways, are allowlists:

- Upstream, only `accept`, `user-agent` and the adapter's own provider headers
  (`openai-beta`, or `anthropic-version` and `anthropic-beta`) are copied from the client;
  `content-type` is always `application/json`, since the body is JSON the gateway serialized.
  The provider key goes in the adapter's auth header. The client's `authorization`,
  `x-api-key`, `cookie`, `x-spanlight-*`, `host`, `content-length` and everything else stay
  behind (and the upstream client keeps no cookie jar, so it adds no `cookie` of its own).
- Back to the client, only `content-type`, `retry-after`, `x-ratelimit-*`,
  `anthropic-ratelimit-*` and `openai-processing-ms` are kept, and the provider's
  `request-id` or `x-request-id` becomes `x-upstream-request-id`.
