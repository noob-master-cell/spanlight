"""Deliver an alert to PagerDuty as an Events API v2 event.

The outbox row's target is `{"channel_id"}`; the channel's sealed secret is the routing key. A
firing alert (and a budget breach) sends `trigger`, a resolved one `resolve`; both carry
`dedup_key = spanlight-rule-<rule_id>`, so PagerDuty folds repeats into one incident and the
resolve closes the incident the trigger opened. PagerDuty answers 202 on success; 429 and 5xx are
retried and any other refusal (400 for a bad routing key or body) is permanent.

A channel's test-send must not page anyone or leave an incident behind: it sends a `trigger`
with severity `info` (whatever the channel is set to) and `dedup_key = spanlight-test-<channel_id>`,
then a `resolve` with the same key. A failed resolve is logged and does not fail the delivery, so
a retry cannot trigger a second time.

An alert's `trigger` is skipped when its event has already resolved. A trigger that was retried
after a PagerDuty outage can reach PagerDuty after the `resolve` that followed it, and would open
an incident nothing closes.
