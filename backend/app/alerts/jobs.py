"""The `evaluate_alerts` job: evaluate every enabled alert rule, once a minute.

One query, with row-level security bypassed, lists the projects that have enabled rules; each
project is then evaluated in sessions bound to it alone (see `evaluation.py`), one transaction
per rule. All reads of a pass share one `now` and one metric cache, so rules over the same
metric, window and filters read the database once.

The job has a single attempt: the next pass a minute later is the retry. A pass stops starting
projects, and rules within a project, after `RUN_BUDGET_SECONDS` so it ends inside the worker's
task timeout; projects and rules that waited longest go first, so the ones a slow pass did not
reach lead the next one.
