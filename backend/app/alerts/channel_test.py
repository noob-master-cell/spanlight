"""Send a test notification through a channel and report how it went (`POST .../test`).

The test goes through the outbox like a real alert: the rows are committed, then delivered in
this process with `deliver_now`, so the answer says whether the channel works. A row that fails
in a way a retry might fix stays pending for the worker. An email channel gets one row per
recipient who is still a verified member (a departed one is skipped and logged), and the answer
reports the first failure. A test that goes through records the time as the channel's
`verified_at`.

Each channel may be tested 10 times an hour (`CHANNEL_TEST_LIMITER`, keyed `alert-test:<id>`).
