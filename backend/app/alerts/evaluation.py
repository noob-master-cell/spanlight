"""Evaluate one project's alert rules, each in a transaction of its own.

For one rule the transaction locks the rule, reads its metric, runs the state machine, writes the
state row (every pass), and on a state change writes the event and queues every notification.
All of that commits together or not at all: a rule whose evaluation fails is rolled back alone,
counted as an error, and the project's other rules still run.
