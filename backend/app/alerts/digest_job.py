"""The `weekly_digest` job: email each project's week to the members of its organization.

The scheduler enqueues one job per period (see `jobs/scheduler.py`); it becomes runnable on
Monday 08:00 UTC and summarises the seven whole UTC days that ended at Monday 00:00. One query,
with row-level security bypassed, lists the projects that have the digest on and had traffic that
week. Each project is then handled in its own transaction, bound to it alone: its figures and
its Doctor insights (`app.insights.digest`) are read, the message is rendered once, and one
`email` outbox row per verified member is queued.

Idempotency: a job that is retried (it has three attempts) or runs twice must not mail anyone
twice. Every row carries `summary.digest_key = weekly_digest:<project>:<week start>`, which the
outbox keeps after the row is settled. A project's rows are queued in one transaction, under an
advisory lock on that key, and only if no row with the key exists, so a project is either
complete or absent. A run that failed for some projects raises at the end; its retry fills in
exactly those.
