"""An alert channel's delivery log: reading it and retrying a delivery that failed. Callers commit.

The log lists the channel's outbox rows (`app.notifications.queries`), email recipients and test
sends included. A retry is a write under the organization, so it takes the organization's write
lock first, like every channel write (`app.alerts.service`), then writes the audit event. The
audit metadata holds the channel's name and kind and the delivery's id, never an address.
