========== ============================================ ========================================
llm_calls  spans of kind ``llm``                        ``0``

p95_ms     llm span duration                            ``None``
ttft_p95   llm time to first token, measured ones only  ``None`` (also when none measured one)
tokens     input + output tokens, every kind            ``0``
cost_usd   priced spans of every kind (a lower bound)   ``0``; ``None`` when spans exist and none
                                                        is priced
spend      as ``cost_usd``                              as ``cost_usd``
========== ============================================ ========================================

``spend`` is what budgets read. It is computed exactly like ``cost_usd``; a budget passes only the
filter of its own scope, never an environment, provider or model of its choosing.

Source split: the whole hours of a window that start strictly before ``floor_hour(now) - 1 h``
are read from the hourly rollups (complete by then); everything else is read from raw spans: the
partial hour at the window's start, the partial hour at its end when that is older than the
split, and everything from the split on. Counts, tokens and cost are therefore exact everywhere.
Only a percentile that merged any rollup hour is ``approximate``: it is estimated from the merged
histograms (the raw part is bucketed the same way). A ``source_key_id`` or ``external_user_id``
filter exists only on raw rows, so it makes the whole window read raw spans.

Values are ``Decimal``; percentiles arrive as ``float`` and are converted through ``str``.
