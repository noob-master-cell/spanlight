"""Add the error class of a failed span.

Revision ID: 0400
Revises: 0307
Create Date: 2026-10-10

`spans.error_class` says what kind of failure a span is: `auth`, `rate_limit`, `timeout`,
`context_length`, `content_filter`, `provider_5xx`, `network`, `client` or `unknown`. Ingestion
computes it (`app.ingest.error_class.classify_error`) from the span's status, its status message
and the status attributes; it is NULL exactly when the span did not fail. The trace explorer
filters on it and the insight detectors count failures by it.

Choices worth knowing about:

* The column is nullable with no default, so adding it rewrites nothing. Spans ingested before
  this migration keep NULL: their class is unknown, not `unknown`, and nothing backfills it.
* The CHECK lists the values `ErrorClass` defines; a new class needs a migration that widens it.
  It also refuses a class on a span that did not fail. The converse (a failed span always has a
  class) cannot be checked, since spans written before this migration have none.
* Every step runs outside the migration's transaction (`autocommit_block()`), each statement
  committing on its own, as 0202 does for `spans`. Adding the column and the `NOT VALID`
  constraint changes only the catalog, under an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock held for milliseconds; the
  migration waits at most 5 seconds for it (`lock_timeout`) rather than stall every ingest queued
  behind the wait. `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` then scans the table in its own statement under SHARE
  UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, which lets ingestion and reads continue.
* `spans_project_error_class_started_idx (project_id, error_class, started_at DESC)` is partial,
  `WHERE error_class IS NOT NULL`: only failed spans enter it, which keeps it small. It is built
  `CONCURRENTLY`, as 0302 builds its index, so ingestion keeps writing during the build. An
  interrupted build leaves an INVALID index behind; the leftover is dropped first. Every other
  step is safe to repeat as well, so running the migration again after a failure is safe.

Downgrade drops the index (concurrently), then the column with its CHECK, under the same 5 second
lock wait cap.
