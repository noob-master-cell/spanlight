"""Add per-organization price overrides.

Revision ID: 0205
Revises: 0204
Create Date: 2026-10-09

An override is an organization's own rate for a model, for negotiated discounts, self-hosted
models and providers the seed table does not list. At ingestion the organization's overrides are
loaded next to the seed prices and win over a seed row for the same provider and pattern; no
other organization ever sees them.

Choices worth knowing about:

* The money columns match `model_prices` (`numeric(12, 6)`, not negative), so a rate means the
  same thing in both tables.
* `provider` and `model_pattern` are stored lower-case, as the seed table does, because the
  price lookup lower-cases the model it is given. The CHECKs make the stored form the only form.
* The table is scoped to an organization, not a project, so it has no row-level security: every
  query filters by `org_id` (`app.pricing.queries`). `org_id` cascades, so deleting an
  organization deletes its overrides.
* `UNIQUE (org_id, provider, model_pattern, effective_from)` makes a duplicate a
  `409 PRICE_OVERRIDE_EXISTS`. Its index leads with `org_id`, so it also serves the foreign key
  and the per-organization read at ingestion; a separate `org_id` index would duplicate it.
* `created_by` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`: removing a person keeps the overrides they added.
