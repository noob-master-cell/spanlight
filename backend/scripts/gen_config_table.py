"""Render the `Settings` fields as the configuration reference of the documentation site.

Run from `backend/` after adding, removing or changing a setting:

    uv run python scripts/gen_config_table.py            # rewrite the table
    uv run python scripts/gen_config_table.py --check    # exit 1 if the page is out of date

The tables are written into `docs-site/src/content/docs/configuration.md` between the
`BEGIN GENERATED SETTINGS` and `END GENERATED SETTINGS` markers; everything outside them is
written by hand. Names, types and defaults come from `app.config.Settings`. The prose cannot, so
`DESCRIPTIONS` holds one sentence per setting, and the script refuses to run while a setting has
none (or a description names a setting that no longer exists): a new setting cannot ship
undocumented. Defaults of secrets are never printed.
