# Waits until the load-test database is quiet, so one k6 script does not start while the work of
# the one before it is still running.
#
# k6 gives up on a request after its timeout, but the server keeps running the query, and the
# worker may still be rolling up hours (its job retries after a timeout). Without a pause the next
# scenario would measure the leftovers of the last one, on a database whose cache they have just
# churned.
#
# Quiet means two readings, two seconds apart, with no query of the application role executing
# and no job running. It gives up after SETTLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (default 120), says so as a
# workflow warning, and exits 0: a database that never calms down is part of the measurement.
# A poll that fails or takes over 10 seconds counts as "not settled yet" and warns. The script
# always exits 0, because the workflow runs it under `bash -e` and a failure here would skip the
# k6 script that follows.
#
# Needs the same environment as the workflow's other steps: LOAD_ENV_FILE (the Compose env file)
# and, when the stack is not the default project, COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME and COMPOSE_FILE.
#
#   LOAD_ENV_FILE=deploy/.env backend/load/settle.sh

# No `set -e`: every failure below is handled, and the exit status is always 0.
