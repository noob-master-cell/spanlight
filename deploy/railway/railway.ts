// Railway project for the Spanlight public demo: Railway Postgres plus
// three services built from deploy/Dockerfile.
//
//   api     FastAPI. Pre-deploy runs migrations as the Postgres owner, then the
//           app connects as the non-superuser spanlight_app role so RLS applies.
//   worker  Same image, `python -m app.jobs.worker`. No HTTP, no healthcheck.
//   web     Caddy: serves the SPA and proxies /api, /v1, /health to api over the
//           private network. The only service with a public domain.
//
// This is a Railway Infrastructure as Code file. Config as Code (railway.toml,
// railway.json) is deprecated and new services can't use it. Apply from the
// repository root:
//
//   npm install --prefix deploy/railway           # once: the `railway` SDK
//   railway config plan  --file deploy/railway/railway.ts
//   railway config apply --file deploy/railway/railway.ts
//
// Step by step, including secrets, domain and verification: docs/deploy/railway.md
//
// "${{service.VAR}}" strings are Railway reference variables, resolved by Railway
// when it deploys. Secrets never live in this file: preserve() keeps the value set
// with `railway variable set NAME --stdin`. A variable that exists in Railway but
// not here is deleted on the next apply, so declare new ones here too.
//
// preserve() expects the variable to exist: an apply stops on one that has no value yet (see
// docs/deploy/railway.md). So the optional settings of later features are commented-out opt-in
// blocks below. To enable a feature, set its variables with `railway variable set NAME --stdin
// --service <service> --skip-deploys`, uncomment its block on each service named, then apply.
