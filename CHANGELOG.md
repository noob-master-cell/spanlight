# Changelog

All notable changes to Spanlight are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project is pre-1.0, so minor versions may change behaviour; breaking changes are called out.

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

The Doctor: Spanlight reads your traces, opens findings about how your application calls LLMs, and shows what changed between releases and who drives cost.

### Added

- **Error class, request hash and finish reason on LLM spans.** Every failed span gets one class (`auth`, `rate_limit`, `timeout`, `context_length`, `content_filter`, `provider_5xx`, `network`, `client` or `unknown`) from its HTTP status or message, and Traces can be filtered by it. Spans carry a `request_hash` (the same model and request give the same hash, computed before payload capture so it exists even when inputs are not stored) and a canonical `finish_reason` (`stop`, `length`, `tool_calls`, `content_filter` or `other`) for OpenAI, Anthropic and OTLP spans. Gateway spans for faults that answer before the provider call now record the simulated status and `Retry-After`. Spans stored before this release have none of these and are not backfilled.
- **Fifteen detectors.** Deterministic rules over a project's recent spans: `error_spike`, `latency_regression`, `cost_spike`, `retry_storm`, `retry_after_ignored`, `rate_limit_pressure`, `truncated_outputs`, `context_growth`, `cache_opportunity`, `tool_loop`, `truncated_stream_accepted`, `unsupported_parameter_retried`, `client_timeout_misconfigured`, `unpriced_spend` and `provider_incident`. They run every 15 minutes for each project with traffic in the last 24 hours, skip calls the Integration Lab faulted when they judge traffic or provider health, and return nothing below a minimum sample size. Each finding carries its evidence (up to 20 traces), the layer where it fails, whether it is measured or inferred, a suggested fix and a way to verify it. The catalogue, thresholds and fixes are on the new Doctor page of the documentation.
- **Insights lifecycle.** A problem is one insight however often it recurs: it counts occurrences, resolves itself after 24 hours without a sighting, and reopens if it returns. Admins and owners can acknowledge, resolve, mute (up to 90 days, with a reason) and unmute. A project's insight notifications go to a list of its organization's alert channels; only a critical insight that opens notifies, once, as an `insight.opened` webhook event (signed like alert events), a Slack message, an email or a PagerDuty trigger. The weekly digest gains an Insights section.
- **Health score.** Overview shows a 0 to 100 score: 100 minus penalties for open critical and warning insights, error rate, a slower p95 and higher spend than the previous window. It is "—", never 0, when the window has no LLM calls.
- **Explain with Claude.** An opt-in button on an insight asks Claude to explain the finding from its evidence. Admins and owners only, capped per organization at `EXPLAIN_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` a month with the cost reserved up front, shown under an "Advisory" label as plain text. Only redacted excerpts of at most five example traces are sent, through the organization's own Anthropic credential and traced into the project.
- **Releases.** Set a release with the SDK, the OTLP `service.version` attribute or the gateway header `x-spanlight-release`. The Releases page lists releases in a range and compares two: deltas, model mix, error classes and new error messages, with exact percentiles over a range of up to 30 days.
- **Users.** The Users page ranks end users (the SDK `user_id`, OTLP `user.id` or `x-spanlight-user`) by cost, errors or traces over whole UTC days, with a daily chart and recent sessions for each. Statistics are refreshed every 15 minutes. Releases and Users can also be read with a project API key that has the `traces:read` scope.
- **Lab example clients.** `examples/` holds a deliberately naive client and a corrected one that run the Integration Lab scenarios against the gateway. The naive client opens the matching finding for each scenario and the corrected one opens none.
- **Doctor screens.** Doctor (list and detail with evidence, fix, verification and actions), Releases, Users, a health tile on Overview, insight badges on traces, an error-class filter on Traces and an Insight notifications setting in Settings, Project.
- **Operations.** `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/detector-runs` shows what each detector did on its last passes. New Prometheus metrics (`spanlight_detector_runs_total`, `spanlight_detector_duration_seconds`, `spanlight_insights_open`, `spanlight_detector_projects_skipped_total`) feed a Doctor row on the Grafana dashboard. A new runbook covers detector runs, a project that times out, muting and the explanation budget.

### Changed

- **`insight.opened` joins the notification payloads.** Webhook, Slack, email and PagerDuty channels render it next to alert events; PagerDuty uses a dedup key that is stable for the insight and never sends a resolve for one.
- **The gateway reads `x-spanlight-release`** (1 to 128 characters) into the trace, so release comparison covers traffic that has no SDK.
- **Gateway `Retry-After` handling.** The provider's `retry-after-ms` header is now passed back to the client next to `retry-after`, and the gateway honours and records the millisecond value first.
- **A Lab `malformed_json` call is recorded as failed.** It still answers `200` with the cut body, but its span has status `error` and the message `200 FAULT_MALFORMED_JSON: …`, so a client's reaction to it is judged like any other failure.

### SDK

- **Request hash and finish reason on LLM spans.** The OpenAI and Anthropic wrappers now send a `request_hash` (a stable hash of the model and request parameters, computed before payload capture so it exists even when inputs are not stored) and the provider's raw `finish_reason` (the first choice's `finish_reason` for OpenAI, `stop_reason` for Anthropic, streams included). Manual spans can call `span.set_request_hash(...)` and `span.set_finish_reason(...)`.

### Settings

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DETECTORS_ENABLED` | `true` | Schedule the detector job. Off, no new insights appear. |
| `EXPLAIN_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` | The model behind "Explain with Claude". It must have a price. |
| `EXPLAIN_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD` | `1.00` | Most an organization may spend on explanations per UTC month. `0` turns them off. |
| `USER_STATS_ENABLED` | `true` | Schedule the refresh of per-user daily statistics behind the Users page. |

### Migrations

Run `spanlight migrate` (or restart the stack) after upgrading. Migrations 0400 to 0405 add the error class, request hash and finish reason columns on spans, the insights, detector runs and insight explanations tables, the project's insight channel list, the per-user daily statistics table and a release index on traces. Migrations 0400, 0401 and 0405 build their indexes `CONCURRENTLY`: writes continue, and on a large table the build takes a few minutes and extra disk.

## [0.4.0] - Unreleased

Alerts and budgets: get told when error rate, latency, volume or cost crosses a line, and stop runaway spend at the gateway.

### Added

- **Alert channels.** Organization-wide channels for email, Slack incoming webhooks, signed webhooks and PagerDuty (Events API v2). Email goes only to verified members of the organization. A channel can be tested, and its delivery log shows every send with its status, attempts and last error; a failed delivery can be retried by hand. Slack URLs, PagerDuty routing keys and webhook signing secrets are encrypted with `CREDENTIALS_KEYS`, never returned, and a webhook's secret is shown once, when it is created or rotated.
- **Signed webhooks.** Each request carries `X-Spanlight-Event`, `X-Spanlight-Delivery`, `X-Spanlight-Timestamp` and an HMAC-SHA256 `X-Spanlight-Signature`, with a documented verification procedure and test vector. Failures are retried with backoff for up to 8 attempts.
- **Alert rules.** Threshold rules and anomaly rules (a band of a chosen number of standard deviations around the average of the previous windows) on error rate, p95 latency, p95 time to first token, LLM calls, tokens and cost, filtered by environment, provider or model, with a 7-day preview before you save. Rules are evaluated every 60 seconds with a cooldown after each resolve, can be muted for up to 30 days, and their events can be acknowledged. A metric with no data never fires or resolves a rule.
- **Budgets.** Daily or monthly (UTC) spend caps per project, gateway key, end user or model, each set to notify or to block. A budget notifies its channels when its spend passes the amount and again when it recovers.
- **Blocking budgets.** The gateway answers `402 BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, in the OpenAI or Anthropic error shape, to calls in the scope of a blocking budget that is exceeded. Ingestion is never blocked. Blocking lags spend by up to one evaluation, about a minute.
- **Weekly digest.** Every Monday at 08:00 UTC, members with a verified email get one summary per project of spend, LLM calls, error rate, p95 latency, top models by cost and alerts fired. It can be turned off per project in project settings and needs an email provider.
- **Dashboard screens.** Alerts (Rules and Channels) and Budgets, with the rule editor and preview, mute and acknowledge, the event timeline, and the delivery log.
- **Grafana alert panels.** Rules evaluated by outcome, transitions by kind, evaluation duration, outbox backlog, deliveries by kind and outcome, and budget blocks. `/health/ready` reports `alert_evaluation_lag_s`.
- **`spanlight alerts evaluate`.** Runs one evaluation pass by hand, with `--dry-run` to roll it back and `--json` for scripts, which is also how the evaluation load test is timed.
- **Documentation.** Guides for alerts and channels, budgets and the weekly digest, plus a runbook for stuck and failed deliveries, a rotated webhook secret and late evaluation.

### Changed

- **Outbox leases and fencing.** A worker now claims an outbox row with a 60 second lease and a fencing token and sends outside any database transaction. A worker whose lease expired can no longer settle the row, and a crashed worker's rows are claimed again by the next run. Delivery is at least once.
- **Failed alert payloads are kept.** Payload reduction after a delivery settles now keeps the payload of a failed alert delivery so it can be retried; sent rows and failed transactional mail (verification, reset, invite) are reduced as before.
- **Egress protection is a shared module.** The check that refuses private, loopback, link-local and reserved addresses on every connection moved from the gateway into `app/core/egress.py` and now also guards webhook, Slack and PagerDuty deliveries.
- **Outbound URLs stay out of logs.** `httpx` and `httpcore` log at WARNING and Sentry's `httpx` integration is off, so a Slack or webhook URL can never reach a log line or an error report.
- **Model filters match snapshot names.** An alert or budget filter on `gpt-4o` also matches `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` and `gpt-4o-latest`, but not `gpt-4o-mini`, the same rule the price table uses.
- **SMTP on port 465.** With `SMTP_PORT=465` the email sender connects with implicit TLS (SMTPS) and checks the certificate, for networks that block port 587.
- **The gateway budget guard is real.** The hook added in 0.3.0 now reads the evaluated state of blocking budgets instead of allowing every call.

### Security

- Alert email cannot be used to write to strangers: recipients must be verified members, checked when the channel is saved and again when the message is queued (`ALERT_EMAIL_ANY_RECIPIENT` lifts it for a closed deployment).
- Webhook URLs must be `https://` and resolve only to public addresses, checked when the channel is saved and on every connection, so a DNS change after the check does not get around it. Redirects are never followed, and response bodies are capped before they reach `last_error`. `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` lifts both rules for a receiver inside a private network.
- Channel secrets are never written to a log, the audit log or `last_error`.

### Settings

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALERTS_EVALUATION_ENABLED` | `true` | Schedule the once-a-minute alert and budget evaluation. |
| `WEEKLY_DIGEST_ENABLED` | `true` | Schedule the Monday digest email. |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | `false` | Allow `http://` and private addresses for webhook channels. |
| `ALERT_EMAIL_ANY_RECIPIENT` | `false` | Allow email channels to send to addresses that are not verified members. |
| `PAGERDUTY_EVENTS_URL` | `https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue` | Where PagerDuty channels send events. |

### Migrations

Run `spanlight migrate` (or restart the stack) after upgrading. Migrations 0300 to 0307 add the outbox lease columns, the alert channel, rule, state, event and budget tables, the weekly digest switch on projects, and three indexes. Migrations 0302 (end-user traces), 0306 (a channel's deliveries) and 0307 (weekly digest lookups) build their indexes `CONCURRENTLY`: writes continue, and on a large table the build takes a few minutes and extra disk.

## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

The LLM gateway and the Integration Lab: point the official OpenAI or Anthropic client at Spanlight with one base URL and every call is traced, priced, limited and, if you configure it, routed, retried, cached and fault-injected.

### Added

- **LLM gateway.** `POST /gw/v1/chat/completions`, `POST /gw/v1/responses`, `POST /gw/v1/messages` and `GET /gw/v1/models` accept OpenAI and Anthropic requests, streaming and tool calls included, and forward the provider's answer unchanged. Errors come back in the provider's own shape with a stable `spanlight_code`. Each call becomes one `llm` span with the gateway's route, target, attempts and overhead, and can join a trace you already started with the `x-spanlight-*` headers.
- **Provider credentials.** Organization owners store OpenAI, Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible API keys. Keys are encrypted with `CREDENTIALS_KEYS`, never returned, and can be checked, rotated and re-sealed under a new master key with `spanlight reseal-credentials`. The gateway refuses to connect to private, loopback, link-local and other reserved addresses, on every connection, unless `GATEWAY_ALLOW_INSECURE_BASE_URLS` is set for a local model server.
- **Routes.** Weighted targets, per-target model aliases, retries with backoff and `Retry-After`, fallbacks to the next target, and a time budget for the whole call. Every save is a numbered version with revert, and a stale edit is refused with `409 ROUTE_VERSION_CONFLICT`.
- **Gateway keys and limits.** Project-scoped `spl_gw_…` keys, accepted as a bearer token or `x-api-key`, with a route, an environment, requests and tokens per minute, an allowed-model list and default tags. `GATEWAY_ORG_RPM_CEILING` caps an organization across its keys.
- **Response cache.** Opt-in per key with a time to live. Exact match on the surface, route, route version and request body, for non-streaming `200` answers up to 1 MB. `X-Spanlight-Cache` reports `hit`, `miss`, `off` or `bypass`, and a project's cache can be purged.
- **Budget guard hook.** The gateway asks a budget guard before every provider call and answers `402 BUDGET_EXCEEDED` when it says no. The guard that ships allows every call; budget rules arrive in a later release.
- **Price overrides.** An organization can set its own per-model prices (`/api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/price-overrides`). They win over the built-in table for spans ingested afterwards, and such spans record `pricing_version` `override:<id>`.
- **Integration Lab.** Fault profiles inject nine provider failures into non-production keys: expired or denied keys, rate limits, an unsupported parameter, server errors, a cut-off JSON body, a stream that ends early, a slow first byte and a timeout. Faulted calls are marked by `X-Spanlight-Fault`, a `FAULT_<SCENARIO>` code and a `lab:<scenario>` trace tag.
- **Standalone gateway.** `GATEWAY_MODE=standalone` runs the gateway as its own process (`python -m app.gateway`, same image) behind the `standalone-gateway` Compose profile, so LLM traffic can scale and fail apart from the dashboard API. `disabled` turns it off. There is a new runbook for it.
- **Demo through the gateway.** The demo project's LLM calls now go through the gateway with the demo project's own key, so the demo exercises the same path as a real application.
- **Gateway load test.** The k6 load tests gain a scenario that measures the time a call spends in Spanlight against a fake provider, with a target of under 20 ms at p95, and `docs/performance.md` explains the method.
- **Dashboard screens.** A Gateway section with Overview (traffic, errors, cache hit rate, fallbacks and retries per target), Keys, Routes with a versioned editor, Credentials and Lab. New Prometheus metrics cover gateway requests, overhead, upstream time and attempts; Grafana panels show requests, overhead, attempts, cache hits and spans not recorded.
- **Documentation.** Gateway guides for the quickstart, routing, the cache, the Lab, credentials and error responses.

### Changed

- **`CREDENTIALS_KEYS` now also protects provider credentials.** Rotate it in two phases and run `spanlight reseal-credentials` before dropping an old key (see the rotate-secrets runbook).
- **Audit log.** Gateway configuration changes (credentials, routes, keys, fault profiles, cache purges and price overrides) are recorded as audit events.

### Security

- Provider API keys are write-only: they are never returned by the API, written to a log or kept in an `Idempotency-Key` record, and responses that describe a credential carry `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Gateway keys are stored as hashes, compared in constant time, and redacted from logs and spans.
- The gateway never forwards the client's `Authorization`, `x-api-key`, cookies or `x-spanlight-*` headers to a provider, does not follow redirects, and sends no CORS headers.
- Fault injection cannot run on a key whose environment is `production`, checked when a profile is attached and again on every call.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

Production hardening: accounts and access control, a versioned API, durable background work, backups and exports, observability of Spanlight itself, and documentation.

### Added

- **Accounts.** Email verification and password reset by email (links carry the token in the URL fragment; verification links expire after 24 hours, reset links after 1 hour). Sign in with GitHub and Google. Two-factor authentication with an authenticator app and recovery codes, which an organization owner can require for all members.
- **Access tokens.** Personal access tokens (`spl_pat_…`) for scripts and CI, with a `read` or `write` scope and an optional expiry, revocable at any time.
- **API keys.** Project API keys carry scopes (`ingest:write`, `traces:read`) and an optional expiry. Existing keys keep `ingest:write` and never expire.
- **Idempotency keys.** State-changing API requests accept an `Idempotency-Key` header, so a retried request runs once.
- **Dashboard at scale.** Hourly rollups with bucketed latency histograms back every time window longer than 24 hours; those responses are marked `"approximate": true`. Shorter windows still read the spans directly.
- **Shared rate limits.** Limits for ingestion, the demo and bearer reads are enforced in Postgres, so they hold across replicas and across restarts. A limited request gets `429` with `Retry-After`.
- **Object storage and backups.** Any S3-compatible store (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO) can hold nightly `pg_dump` backups, kept for 14 daily and 8 weekly copies, and `spanlight restore` loads one back.
- **Exports.** Export traces as CSV or JSONL, and the audit log as CSV. Download links last one hour and files are deleted after seven days.
- **Price endpoints.** `GET /api/v1/prices` lists the price table, and `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/unpriced-models` shows which models in your traffic have no known price.
- **Organization and project administration.** Rename or delete an organization or a project through the API, with a typed confirmation for deletes.
- **Observability of Spanlight itself.** Optional self-tracing with OpenTelemetry, a readiness check (`/health/ready`) that reports the database, the migrations and the worker, and Prometheus metrics for the worker (jobs, outbox, notifications, rollups) on `WORKER_METRICS_PORT`.
- **Operations.** Runbooks for deploying, rolling back, restoring, rotating secrets, revoking keys, scaling, ingestion spikes and service level objectives, plus a threat model and security documentation.
- **Documentation site.** Quickstart, Python SDK, OTLP, self-hosting, configuration, API reference, security, runbooks and this changelog, served at `/docs/` by the web image.
- **Load tests.** k6 scripts and a seeder in `backend/load/` measure ingestion (500 spans a second), the dashboard overview and the trace list (10 million spans) against the Compose stack, and a manually started workflow runs them on a GitHub-hosted runner. Method and targets are in `docs/performance.md`.

### Changed

- **Versioned API.** Dashboard routes moved from `/api/<resource>` to `/api/v1/<resource>`. The old paths return `404`. Ingestion (`/v1/traces`, `/v1/otlp/traces`) keeps its own version and is unchanged. A future breaking change will ship as `/api/v2`, with `/api/v1` kept for at least 12 months.
- **Postgres shared memory.** The Compose `postgres` service gets 256 MB of `/dev/shm` instead of Docker's 64 MB default, which parallel queries on large tables could exhaust ("could not resize shared memory segment").
- **Dashboard queries at 10 million spans.** Migration 0016 swaps the `spans` time index for a covering one, so a 24 hour overview is answered from the index and not from the table. It is built `CONCURRENTLY`: writes continue, and on a large table it takes minutes and extra disk.
- **Row-level security policies read their settings once per statement.** Migration 0017 rewrites the tenant-isolation and worker-bypass policies of `traces`, `spans`, the rollup tables and `exports` so `current_setting()` is evaluated once per query instead of once per row; which rows are visible does not change. It takes a brief exclusive lock on each table and gives up after 5 seconds if it cannot get it, so run it again at a quieter moment.
- **A busy database answers `503`, not `500`.** A request that waits more than 5 seconds for a connection (`API_POOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) or has a statement that runs longer than 10 seconds (`API_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) now gets `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with `Retry-After: 5`.
- **Postgres JIT off in Compose.** The `postgres` service starts with `jit=off`, which costs more than it saves on the dashboard and rollup queries.
- **More than one replica.** Rate limits and idempotency state live in Postgres, so the API can run as several replicas.
- **Optional features report themselves.** A request that needs an unconfigured integration (email, object storage, OAuth, `CREDENTIALS_KEYS`) answers `409 NOT_CONFIGURED` and names the setting; a background job that needs one ends as `skipped_not_configured`.

### Security

- Two-factor seeds are encrypted at rest with the keys in `CREDENTIALS_KEYS`.
- Sign-up is throttled per client IP.
- Password hashing and checking (argon2) run off the event loop, on a small dedicated executor that caps how many hashes run at once, so a burst of sign-ins cannot starve other requests or exhaust memory.
- Requests to `/api/v1` are limited to 1 MiB (`413` above that). Deeply nested JSON sent to ingestion answers `400 INVALID_JSON` instead of `500`.
- `BACKUPS_ENABLED` and `BACKUP_DATABASE_URL` are set only on the worker, the only service that runs backups. The object storage keys stay on both services, because the API signs export download links.
- Responses that reveal a secret (a new API key or access token, recovery codes, a two-factor setup secret) carry `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- The `/metrics` token is compared in constant time.
- The web image runs Caddy as a non-root user.
- Export files are written under a separate key for each attempt, so a retry or a lease takeover can never delete a file another attempt finished. Download links force the browser to save the file instead of showing it.
- A database that is too busy to answer answers `503` with `Retry-After`, not `500`.
- Row-level security policies read their settings once per query. Which rows are visible does not change.

## [0.1.0]

Initial version.

### Added

- **Tracing.** Python SDK (`spanlight`) with `@observe`, spans and wrappers for the OpenAI and Anthropic clients, native JSON ingestion (`POST /v1/traces`) and OTLP ingestion (`POST /v1/otlp/traces`, JSON and protobuf, OpenTelemetry GenAI attributes).
- **Dashboard.** Overview with latency, token, cost and error metrics, a trace explorer with a span waterfall, and session views.
- **Cost.** Versioned per-model prices; a model without a known price shows as unknown, never as $0.
- **Teams.** Organizations, projects, roles, invites, API keys and an audit log.
- **Privacy.** Postgres row-level security, secret redaction before storage, and per-project switch for payload capture.
- **Self-hosting.** One Docker image with `api`, `worker` and `web` roles, a Compose file and a Railway deployment guide.
