# OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 Level 2 checklist

A self-assessment of Spanlight against the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard 4.0.3](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v4.0.3), Level 2. It covers the Level 1 and Level 2 requirements of chapters V1 to V14 that apply to Spanlight's shape: a JSON API, a single-page dashboard, an ingestion endpoint and background workers. The [threat model](threat-model.md) explains the boundaries and lists the residual risks referred to below as R1 to R16.

How to read it:

- **Met:** the requirement holds in the code as shipped. The reference names the module that implements it.
- **Partial:** part of it holds, or it holds only with a deployment choice the operator makes. The note says which part is missing.
- **Not met:** not implemented.
- **N/A:** the requirement is about something Spanlight does not have, or is entirely the operator's.

Requirement texts are shortened; the standard has the full wording. A reference such as `core/security.py` is a path under `backend/app/`; a reference that starts with a top-level directory (`deploy/`, `frontend/`, `.github/`, `backend/tests/`) is a path from the repository root. Left out entirely: Level 3-only requirements, requirements the standard marks as deleted, and sections with no counterpart in Spanlight: V2.7 out-of-band verifiers (email is used for recovery only, never as an authenticator), V2.9 cryptographic verifiers, V5.4.1 and V5.4.2 (Python and TypeScript are memory-safe), V13.3 SOAP and V13.4 GraphQL.

Assessed in October 2026 against the code before the first `1.0` release.

| 1.1.3 | Security constraints in user stories | Partial | Security rules are written into the code's docstrings and the contribution rules, not into user stories | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| 1.1.4 | Trust boundaries, components and data flows documented | Met | | [threat model](threat-model.md) §1 and §4 |
| 1.1.5 | High-level architecture and remote services analysed | Met | | [threat model](threat-model.md) §4, TB5 and TB6 |

| 1.8.2 | Protection requirements per protection level | Partial | Assets are listed with their protection, without formal levels | [threat model](threat-model.md) §2 |
| 1.9.1 | Encryption between components | Partial | Depends on the deployment (R14) | `deploy/compose.yaml` |

| 1.14.3 | Build pipeline flags outdated or insecure components | Met | Trivy fails the release on fixable HIGH or CRITICAL findings; Dependabot opens updates weekly | `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml` |

| 2.5.3 | Recovery does not reveal the current password | Met | | `auth/password_reset.py` |
