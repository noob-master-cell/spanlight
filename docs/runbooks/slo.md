# Service level objectives and alerts

## Purpose and when to use

This page defines what "healthy" means for a Spanlight deployment, how to measure it, and the Prometheus rules that tell you when it is not. Use it to set up monitoring once, and during an incident to decide how bad things are and which runbook to open.

## The objectives

| # | Objective | Target | Window | Measured at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Availability | 99.5 % of requests are not server errors | 30 days, rolling | the api, `/api/*` and `/v1/*` |
| 2 | Ingest latency | p95 of `POST /v1/traces` and `POST /v1/otlp/traces` is at most 200 ms | 30 days, rolling | the api |
| 3 | Dashboard latency | p95 of the dashboard read routes is at most 300 ms | 30 days, rolling | the api |

Details:

- **Availability.** A request is good unless the api answers it with a 5xx status (an unhandled exception is counted as a 500). 4xx responses are not failures: they are the client's doing, and that includes `429` (see [ingestion-spike.md](ingestion-spike.md) for sustained 429s). `/health/*` and `/metrics` are not counted. The error budget is 0.5 %, which is 3 hours 36 minutes of total outage in 30 days.
- **Ingest latency.** The time the api takes to handle an ingest request, from the first byte in to the last byte out, as seen by the api. It includes validation, redaction, pricing and the database transaction. It excludes the network between the sender and Caddy.
- **Dashboard latency.** The same measure for `GET` on a project's traces (list and detail), sessions, filters and the three metrics routes (`overview`, `timeseries`, `models`).

These targets assume one api replica with a sensibly sized Postgres. If you run a much larger workload, change the numbers to match what you promise your users; keep the alert expressions in step.

## Metrics that exist

The api serves `/metrics` on port 8000, and the worker serves its own on port 9100 when `WORKER_METRICS_PORT` is set (`deploy/compose.yaml` sets it; the port is not published). Both use the `METRICS_TOKEN` bearer token. These are the series the rules below use; all are defined in `backend/app/core/observability.py`. Each process reports only what it records.

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `spanlight_http_requests_total` | `method`, `route`, `status` | Requests handled. `route` is the matched path template, such as `/v1/traces` or `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/traces`. |
| `spanlight_http_request_duration_seconds` | `method`, `route` | Request latency histogram (`_bucket`, `_sum`, `_count`) with the client library's default buckets: 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750 ms, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 s. |
| `spanlight_ingested_spans_total` | `source` (`native`, `otlp`) | Spans accepted. |
| `spanlight_rejected_spans_total` | `source` | Spans rejected by validation. |
| `spanlight_rate_limit_rejections_total` | `scope` (`ingest`, `demo`, `api`) | Requests refused with 429 by a rate limit. |
| `spanlight_idempotency_requests_total` | `outcome` | Requests carrying an `Idempotency-Key`, by outcome. |
| `spanlight_jobs_finished_total` | `kind`, `outcome` | **Worker.** Background jobs finished. `outcome` is `done`, `skipped` (finished without work because an integration is not configured or a budget said no), `failed` (out of attempts), `retry` (failed, will run again) or `lease_lost`. |
| `spanlight_rollup_duration_seconds` | none | **Worker.** Time one `rollup_hourly` run took (same default buckets; runs over 10 seconds land in `+Inf`). |
| `spanlight_outbox_pending` | none | **Worker.** Notifications waiting to be sent, set at the end of each delivery run. |
| `spanlight_notifications_delivered_total` | `kind`, `outcome` | **Worker.** Delivery attempts by outcome (`sent`, `retry`, `failed`). |

If the worker is not scraped (no `WORKER_METRICS_PORT`, or a Railway deployment without a scraper), use the SQL and log checks in [Worker and data checks](#worker-and-data-checks) instead; they work either way and are the secondary check when metrics are on.

## Prerequisites: collect the metrics

1. **Scrape the api.** `/metrics` is not proxied by `web`; scrape the api on the internal network, with the bearer token from `METRICS_TOKEN` (without one, the endpoint answers `404`):

   ```yaml
   # prometheus.yml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: spanlight-api
       metrics_path: /metrics
       scrape_interval: 15s
       authorization:
         type: Bearer
         credentials_file: /etc/prometheus/spanlight-metrics-token
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["api:8000"]
   rule_files:
     - /etc/prometheus/spanlight-rules.yml
   ```

   Add the worker as a second target with the same token, in a job named `spanlight-worker`. `deploy/prometheus.yml` is a complete example for the Compose stack:

   ```yaml
     - job_name: spanlight-worker
       metrics_path: /metrics
       authorization:
         type: Bearer
         credentials_file: /etc/prometheus/spanlight-metrics-token
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["worker:9100"]
   ```

   The worker answers `404` until `METRICS_TOKEN` is set on the worker as well as the api, and `401` for a wrong token.
   On Compose, Prometheus has to join the stack's network (`spanlight_default`, from `name: spanlight` in `deploy/compose.yaml`) to resolve `api`. On Railway, run Prometheus as a service of the same project and use the api's private domain and port 8000 as the target.

2. **Keep 30 days of data.** The 30-day rules need Prometheus to retain at least that much (`--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d`; its default is 15 days).

3. **Probe readiness from outside.** The api cannot report that it is down, and neither can a failing scrape tell you whether the problem is the token or the service. `/health/ready` also answers 503 when no worker has reported for 120 seconds or when more than 1000 notifications are overdue by more than 10 minutes, so one probe covers the database, migrations, the worker and the outbox. Probe it through the public address with the Prometheus blackbox exporter (or any uptime monitor that alerts on a non-200):

   ```yaml
     - job_name: spanlight-ready
       metrics_path: /probe
       params:
         module: [http_2xx]
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["https://spanlight.example.com/health/ready"]
       relabel_configs:
         - source_labels: [__address__]
           target_label: __param_target
         - source_labels: [__param_target]
           target_label: instance
         - target_label: __address__
           replacement: blackbox-exporter:9115
   ```

4. **Check that the route labels match the expressions below.** Print the distinct route templates the api reports:

   ```bash
   spl() { docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file deploy/.env "$@"; }
   spl exec -T api python -c "import os, urllib.request as u; r = u.Request('http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics', headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + os.environ['METRICS_TOKEN']}); print(u.urlopen(r).read().decode())" \
     | grep '^spanlight_http_requests_total' | sed -E 's/.*route="([^"]*)".*/\1/' | sort -u
   ```

   Expected (among others): `/v1/traces`, `/v1/otlp/traces`, `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/traces`, `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/metrics/overview`. Generate some traffic first, since a route appears only after its first request. If your templates differ, fix the `route=~` matchers below.

The `runbook` annotations name files in this directory; point them at wherever you host these pages. The worker counters start when the worker process starts, so after a worker restart the first `increase` window has less history; the `for:` delays absorb that. `SpanlightBackupMissing` needs a worker that has run for part of the day, and it fires if backups are not configured, which is the point.

### Availability alerts

When `SpanlightAvailabilityFastBurn` or `SpanlightAvailabilitySlowBurn` fires:

1. Run the first-five-minutes check in [README.md](README.md#first-five-minutes-of-any-incident).
2. Find which route fails: `sum by (route, status) (rate(spanlight_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))`.
3. If it started with a deploy, [roll back](rollback.md). If it is `/health/ready` returning 503 with `"database":"unavailable"`, the database is down or unreachable. If you lost the database, [restore](restore.md).
4. If only ingest fails, see [ingestion-spike.md](ingestion-spike.md); if everything is slow, [scale.md](scale.md).

### Notes on measurement

- **Histogram precision.** The latency histogram has fixed buckets, and `histogram_quantile` interpolates linearly inside a bucket. The 200 ms target sits inside the 100 to 250 ms bucket and the 300 ms target inside the 250 to 500 ms bucket, so the reported p95 is an estimate that can be off by up to the width of its bucket. If you need an exact threshold, count requests under a bucket edge instead, for example the share of ingest requests that finish in 250 ms or less:

  ```promql
  sum(rate(spanlight_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="POST",route=~"/v1/traces|/v1/otlp/traces",le="0.25"}[10m]))
  / sum(rate(spanlight_http_request_duration_seconds_count{method="POST",route=~"/v1/traces|/v1/otlp/traces"}[10m]))
  ```

- **All statuses are in the latency histogram.** The histogram has no `status` label, so fast `401` and `429` responses are included and pull the p95 down slightly. A sustained pile of 429s therefore makes ingest latency look better than it is for accepted requests.
- **No traffic, no ratio.** With zero requests, the error ratio is empty and the burn alerts do not fire. `SpanlightNotReady` and `SpanlightMetricsScrapeDown` cover the case where the service is down and silent.
- **Counter resets.** Restarts reset the api's counters; `rate` and `increase` handle it.

## Worker and data checks

These are the secondary checks. With worker metrics on, the `spanlight-worker-alerts` rules above cover them; the SQL below works without Prometheus, and it is the way to look at a single failed job. Run it as the database owner, from a scheduled job or a monitor that can run a query. The scheduler enqueues `rollup_hourly` every 5 minutes, `deliver_notifications` every 30 seconds and the nightly `backup_database` at 03:00 UTC. `/health/ready` adds two direct checks: `worker_heartbeat_age_s` under 120 and `outbox_backlog` not stuck.

| Check | Query | Healthy | Act when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Worker is scheduling | `SELECT now() - max(created_at) FROM jobs WHERE kind = 'rollup_hourly'` | under 10 minutes | over 15 minutes: the worker is down or cannot reach Postgres ([README.md](README.md#is-the-worker-alive)) |
| Jobs are finishing | `SELECT count(*) FROM jobs WHERE kind = 'rollup_hourly' AND status = 'done' AND created_at > now() - interval '30 minutes'` | 5 or 6 | 0 while the first check is healthy: jobs are stuck or failing |
| Jobs are not failing | `SELECT kind, count(*) FROM jobs WHERE status = 'failed' AND created_at > now() - interval '1 day' GROUP BY kind` | no rows | any row; read `last_error` of those jobs |
| Last backup | `SELECT max(created_at) FROM jobs WHERE kind = 'backup_database' AND status = 'done' AND outcome = 'ok'` | within the last 26 hours | older: the backup is failing or skipped ([restore.md](restore.md) has the setup) |
| Backups configured | `SELECT outcome, count(*) FROM jobs WHERE kind = 'backup_database' AND status = 'done' GROUP BY outcome` | `ok` | `skipped_not_configured`: no backups are being taken |

Run a check from the shell like this:

```bash
spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c \
  "SELECT now() - max(created_at) AS since_last_rollup_job FROM jobs WHERE kind = 'rollup_hourly'"
```

Finished jobs are kept for 7 days. In the worker logs, a failed job writes an error-level `job_failed` line, and a finished one `job_done` with its `outcome`:

```bash
spl logs --since 1h worker | grep job_failed
```

If `SENTRY_DSN` is set, a failed job also arrives in Sentry as an error event.

## Error budget policy

Check `spanlight:http_error_budget_remaining:ratio30d` weekly. While more than half the budget is left, ship as usual. When less than a quarter is left, ship only fixes and security updates, and take a backup before every deploy ([deploy.md](deploy.md)). When it reaches zero, stop feature deploys until the 30-day availability is back above 99.5 %.

## Verification

After setting up:

- `promtool check rules /etc/prometheus/spanlight-rules.yml` reports the rules as valid.
- In Prometheus, `up{job="spanlight-api"}` and `up{job="spanlight-worker"}` are `1` and `spanlight_http_requests_total` and `spanlight_jobs_finished_total` have series with the routes from prerequisite 4.
- `spanlight:http_availability:ratio30d` returns a number once the recording rule has run (it needs traffic).
- To test an alert path end to end, stop the api for a few minutes in a non-production stack (`spl stop api`) and confirm `SpanlightNotReady` fires, then `spl start api`.
