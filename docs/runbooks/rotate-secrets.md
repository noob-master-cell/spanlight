# Rotate secrets

## Purpose and when to use

Replace a secret because it leaked, because someone who knew it left, or on a schedule. This page covers the four application secrets:

| Secret | What it does | Impact of rotating |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Signs CSRF tokens, two-factor login challenges and OAuth state | Nobody is signed out; a few in-flight actions fail once |
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | Bearer token for `/metrics` | Your Prometheus must get the new value |
| `APP_DB_PASSWORD` | Password of the `spanlight_app` database role | A short restart of the api and worker |
| `CREDENTIALS_KEYS` | Master keys that encrypt stored two-factor seeds | Two phases; never drop an old key that still seals data |

Rotate one secret at a time, verify, then do the next. The database owner's password (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) and your Anthropic, S3, SMTP or OAuth credentials are changed with their providers and then in `deploy/.env`; see [Other credentials](#other-credentials).

## Prerequisites

- Write access to `deploy/.env` (Compose) or the Railway project.
- The old value of `CREDENTIALS_KEYS`, kept somewhere other than the database backups. If it is lost, see the warning in that section.
- Docker Compose shortcut:

  ```bash
  spl() { docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file deploy/.env "$@"; }
  ```

- A way to generate a random value. This is the one `deploy/.env.example` recommends:

  ```bash
  python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
  ```

On Railway, set a variable without echoing it, as the [Railway guide](../deploy/railway.md) does:

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32), end="")' \
  | railway variable set NAME --stdin --service api --skip-deploys
```

Then redeploy the service with `railway redeploy --service api`. A variable that is sealed in the Railway dashboard cannot be read back, so keep your own copy of what you set. Variables you set must also be declared in `deploy/railway/railway.ts`, otherwise the next `railway config apply` deletes them.

## SECRET_KEY

**What it protects.** `SECRET_KEY` is the HMAC key behind three things, and only these:

- the CSRF token that is bound to each session cookie;
- the signed token that carries a user between the password step and the two-factor code step of sign-in (valid 5 minutes);
- the signed state of a GitHub or Google sign-in in progress (valid 10 minutes).

Sessions themselves are random server-side tokens stored hashed in Postgres. They do not depend on `SECRET_KEY`, so rotating it does **not** sign anyone out.

**What rotation does.**

- Every existing CSRF cookie stops verifying. The first write a browser makes after the rotation fails with `403 CSRF_FAILED`; the dashboard calls `GET /api/v1/auth/me` on load, which reissues the cookie, so a page reload fixes it.
- A user who is between the password and the two-factor code, or in the middle of a provider sign-in, has to start again.
- API keys, personal access tokens, passwords and sealed two-factor seeds are not affected.

If the rotation is because a session may have been stolen, `SECRET_KEY` is not the lever. End the sessions instead: see [revoke-key.md](revoke-key.md#end-every-session-of-a-user).

### Steps (Docker Compose)

1. Generate a value and put it in `deploy/.env` as `SECRET_KEY=` (replace the old line). It must not be the built-in development value, and it is required when `APP_BASE_URL` is https, or the api refuses to start with `SECRET_KEY must be set when APP_BASE_URL uses https`.
2. Recreate the containers that use it:

   ```bash
   spl up -d
   ```

3. Verify. `spl ps` shows `api` and `worker` running for less than a minute, and:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS "$BASE/health/ready"
   ```

   Expected: `{"status":"ok","database":"ok","migrations":"ok","worker_heartbeat_age_s":4.2,"outbox_backlog":0}`. Then sign in through the dashboard and create or edit something (a project name, for example). That exercises a CSRF-protected write with a freshly issued token.

### Steps (Railway)

`SECRET_KEY` is set on the `api` service only.

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32), end="")' \
  | railway variable set SECRET_KEY --stdin --service api --skip-deploys
railway redeploy --service api
curl -fsS https://$DOMAIN/health/ready
```

**Roll back:** put the old value back and redeploy. Nothing was changed in the database.

## METRICS_TOKEN

**What it protects.** `/metrics` on the api and, when `WORKER_METRICS_PORT` is set, on the worker (neither is reachable through `web`). With no `METRICS_TOKEN` the endpoint answers `404`; with a wrong one it answers `401`.

### Steps (Docker Compose)

1. Generate a value, set `METRICS_TOKEN=` in `deploy/.env`, and recreate:

   ```bash
   spl up -d
   ```

2. Verify from inside the api and worker containers, which hold the new token in their environment (the image has no `curl`, but it has Python). The worker serves its own `/metrics` on port 9100 with the same token when `WORKER_METRICS_PORT` is set (the Compose file sets it):

   ```bash
   spl exec api python -c "import os, urllib.request as u; r = u.Request('http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics', headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + os.environ['METRICS_TOKEN']}); print(u.urlopen(r).status)"
   ```

   ```bash
   spl exec worker python -c "import os, urllib.request as u; r = u.Request('http://127.0.0.1:9100/metrics', headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + os.environ['METRICS_TOKEN']}); print(u.urlopen(r).status)"
   ```

   Expected: `200` from each.
3. Give Prometheus the new token and reload it. Until you do, its scrapes of both the api and the worker get `401` and `up` is `0`, which is why [the SLO alerts](slo.md) wait several minutes before firing. With a file-based credential:

   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: spanlight-api
       metrics_path: /metrics
       authorization:
         type: Bearer
         credentials_file: /etc/prometheus/spanlight-metrics-token
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["api:8000"]
   ```

   Write the new token to that file, then send Prometheus a reload (`kill -HUP <pid>`, or `POST /-/reload` if you started it with `--web.enable-lifecycle`).

### Steps (Railway)

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32), end="")' \
  | railway variable set METRICS_TOKEN --stdin --service api --skip-deploys
railway redeploy --service api
```

Update your scraper, then confirm a scrape returns 200. `railway.ts` declares `METRICS_TOKEN` on the api only; a worker that serves metrics needs the opt-in worker-metrics block ([Optional features](../deploy/railway.md#optional-features)), which adds it there.

**Roll back:** set the old value again and redeploy.

## APP_DB_PASSWORD

**What it protects.** The password of the `spanlight_app` role that the api and worker connect as. It is at least 16 characters (`spanlight ensure-app-role` refuses a shorter one). Use a URL-safe value such as the `token_urlsafe` output above: it is placed inside the `DATABASE_URL` connection string.

**How it changes.** `spanlight ensure-app-role` runs `ALTER ROLE spanlight_app ... PASSWORD <APP_DB_PASSWORD>` as the database owner. The `migrate` service does this on every `up`, so changing the variable and recreating the stack is the whole procedure. Running api and worker processes keep their open connections until they are recreated.

### Steps (Docker Compose)

1. Generate a value and set `APP_DB_PASSWORD=` in `deploy/.env`.
2. Recreate the stack. `migrate` runs first and sets the new password; `api` and `worker` then start with the new connection URL.

   ```bash
   spl up -d
   spl logs migrate
   ```

   Expected from `migrate`:

   ```
   Database is at the latest migration.
   Role spanlight_app is ready (no superuser, no RLS bypass).
   ```

3. Verify the role is still unprivileged and the api can connect with the new password:

   ```bash
   spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -tA -c \
     "SELECT rolname, rolsuper, rolbypassrls FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'spanlight_app'"
   curl -fsS "$BASE/health/ready"
   ```

   Expected: `spanlight_app|f|f` and `{"status":"ok","database":"ok","migrations":"ok","worker_heartbeat_age_s":4.2,"outbox_backlog":0}`.

If the api restarts in a loop with a password authentication error, `deploy/.env` and the database disagree. Set the database back to what `.env` says:

```bash
spl run --rm migrate spanlight ensure-app-role --role spanlight_app
spl restart api worker
```

### Steps (Railway)

`APP_DB_PASSWORD` is set on `api`; the worker's `DATABASE_URL` refers to `${{api.APP_DB_PASSWORD}}`. The api's pre-deploy command runs `ensure-app-role`, so deploying the api changes the password in the database. Use `railway up --service api`, which runs the pre-deploy command; do not rely on `railway redeploy` re-running it.

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32), end="")' \
  | railway variable set APP_DB_PASSWORD --stdin --service api --skip-deploys
railway up --service api
railway redeploy --service worker
curl -fsS https://$DOMAIN/health/ready
```

Watch `railway logs --service api --latest` for `Role spanlight_app is ready (no superuser, no RLS bypass).` before you redeploy the worker. If that line is missing from the deploy logs, the password was not changed in the database: run `railway up --service api` again. The worker needs no pre-deploy step, only the new variable, so `railway redeploy --service worker` is enough for it. Between the two redeploys the worker still holds its old connections; if its restart policy cycles it before the redeploy, it recovers by itself once it has restarted with the new reference.

**Roll back:** set the old value, run `railway up --service api` (the role gets the old password back), then redeploy the worker.

## CREDENTIALS_KEYS

**What it protects.** The master keys that seal two-factor seeds (and other secrets the app must read back) before they reach the database. Format, from `backend/app/core/crypto.py`:

```
<key_id>:<base64 of 32 bytes>[,<key_id>:<base64 of 32 bytes>...]
```

A key id is 1 to 64 letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`. The base64 is the standard alphabet, with padding. **The first entry seals new data; every entry can open data sealed under its id.** That is what makes rotation possible, and it is why you keep the old entry. The api and the worker must hold the same value. A value that breaks the format stops the process at startup with a message such as `CREDENTIALS_KEYS is invalid: entry 1 ...` that names the entry and the rule, never the value.

**Back it up first.** A lost key cannot be recovered: every seed sealed under it becomes unreadable and those users have to enrol again. Keep a copy of the whole value outside the database backups. See [the decision record](../decisions/0009-application-master-key-encryption.md).

There is no command that re-seals existing rows under a new key. Rotation therefore changes the key that seals **new** data and keeps the old key for the old data.

### Steps: add a new key (two phases)

Why two phases: the api seals and the worker opens. If the new key went first on one service while the other did not know it, a seed sealed under it could not be opened. So every service learns the new key before any service seals with it.

1. Generate a key with a new id:

   ```bash
   echo "v2:$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   ```

   Save the output in your password manager now.

2. **Phase one: append the new key after the old one**, on every service that holds `CREDENTIALS_KEYS` (api and worker):

   ```
   CREDENTIALS_KEYS=v1:<old key>,v2:<new key>
   ```

   Compose: edit `deploy/.env` then `spl up -d`. Railway: set the variable on both services with `railway variable set CREDENTIALS_KEYS --stdin --service api --skip-deploys` and the same for `--service worker`, then `railway redeploy` each. New data is still sealed under `v1`.

3. Verify both services are up and ready:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS "$BASE/health/ready"
   spl logs --since 2m worker | grep worker_started
   ```

4. **Phase two: put the new key first:**

   ```
   CREDENTIALS_KEYS=v2:<new key>,v1:<old key>
   ```

   Apply it to both services as in step 2. From now on new two-factor enrolments are sealed under `v2`; existing ones still open under `v1`.

5. Verify. Sign in with an account that has two-factor on (this opens a seed sealed under `v1`), and enrol a second test account (this seals under `v2`). Then see which key each seed uses:

   ```bash
   spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c \
     "SELECT totp_key_id, count(*) FROM users WHERE totp_key_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1"
   ```

### Steps: retire an old key

Only when no row is sealed under it. Check:

```bash
spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c \
  "SELECT email FROM users WHERE totp_key_id = 'v1'"
```

If the key leaked and you must retire it with seeds still under it, turn two-factor off for those users so they enrol again under the new key:

```bash
spl exec worker spanlight reset-2fa --email ada@example.com
```

Expected: `Two-factor authentication turned off for <ada@example.com>; recovery codes deleted.` Repeat for each user in the list, then confirm the query above returns no rows. Only then remove `v1:<old key>` from `CREDENTIALS_KEYS` on both services and redeploy. If you remove a key too early, a user whose seed is sealed under it cannot complete sign-in: the api fails to open the seed with an unknown-key error. Put the key back to recover.

**Roll back:** put the previous value back on both services. As long as the old key is still in the list, nothing sealed is lost. Data sealed under `v2` in the meantime opens only while `v2` stays in the keyring, so do not drop `v2` once a user has enrolled under it.

## Other credentials

- **`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`** (Compose). Postgres reads it only when it creates an empty data directory, so editing `deploy/.env` alone changes nothing in the database and breaks `migrate`. Change it in the database first, with a prompt that keeps it out of your shell history, then in `.env` (and in `BACKUP_DATABASE_URL` if that URL embeds it), then recreate. Note that `up -d` recreates the postgres container when its environment changed, which restarts the database: expect a brief outage.

  ```bash
  spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c '\password postgres'
  # edit deploy/.env: POSTGRES_PASSWORD=..., BACKUP_DATABASE_URL=...
  spl up -d
  ```

  On Railway the owner credentials come from the Postgres service itself; rotate them there.
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `OAUTH_*_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SENTRY_DSN`.** Create the new credential with the provider, set it in `deploy/.env` (or with `railway variable set`), recreate or redeploy, then revoke the old one at the provider. The app reads them at startup, so a restart is required.

## Verification

After any rotation:

- `curl -fsS "$BASE/health/ready"` returns `{"status":"ok","database":"ok","migrations":"ok","worker_heartbeat_age_s":4.2,"outbox_backlog":0}`.
- `spl logs --since 5m api worker` has no startup validation errors (`SECRET_KEY must be set...`, `CREDENTIALS_KEYS is invalid...`) and no repeated password-authentication failures.
- Signing in and a write in the dashboard work.
- The old value no longer appears in `deploy/.env`, your shell history or any chat or ticket where you pasted it.
