# Ingestion spike: 429s, load, and late spans

## Purpose and when to use

Use this when ingestion traffic jumps or misbehaves:

- Senders get `429 RATE_LIMITED` from `POST /v1/traces` or `POST /v1/otlp/traces`.
- The api or database is under load after a burst of traffic.
- A sender was offline, then flushed a backlog, and charts over long windows (a week, a month) are missing spans that the trace list shows.

## Prerequisites

- Shell access and the Compose shortcut:

  ```bash
  spl() { docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file deploy/.env "$@"; }
  ```

- For the metrics queries: a Prometheus that scrapes the api (see [slo.md](slo.md)).

## How ingestion limits work

- **Per-key rate limit.** Each API key gets 50 requests per second, with a burst of 100. The limit counts requests, not spans. It is shared by all api replicas through the `rate_limit_buckets` table in Postgres. The limits are constants in `backend/app/core/ratelimit.py`, not settings; changing them is a code change.
- **A refused request** is `429` with `Retry-After` (whole seconds) and a problem+json body whose `code` is `RATE_LIMITED` and whose `detail` is `Ingestion rate limit exceeded for this key.` The Python SDK honours `Retry-After` and retries (`max_retries`, default 5) before it drops a batch.
- **Request size.** A request may carry at most 1000 spans and 5 MiB (after decompression); beyond that it gets `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`. So one key can in principle ingest up to 50 000 spans a second if its senders batch to the maximum.
- **Late spans.** The api accepts spans that started up to 90 days ago (and end no more than 10 minutes in the future). The rollups that long-window charts read are recomputed only for the last 48 hours.

## 1. See what is happening

Rate of `429` responses and which routes:

```promql
sum by (route) (rate(spanlight_http_requests_total{status="429"}[5m]))
sum by (scope) (rate(spanlight_rate_limit_rejections_total[5m]))
```

Spans accepted and rejected per second, by source (`native` or `otlp`):

```promql
sum by (source) (rate(spanlight_ingested_spans_total[5m]))
sum by (source) (rate(spanlight_rejected_spans_total[5m]))
```

Without Prometheus, the api logs one `http_request` line per request:

```bash
spl logs --since 10m api | grep -c '"status": 429'
spl logs --since 10m api | grep '"status": 429' | tail -3
```

Which key is being throttled? The bucket table holds the tokens left for each key. Keys near zero are the busy ones:

```bash
spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c \
  "SELECT k.name, k.prefix, k.project_id, round(b.tokens::numeric, 1) AS tokens_left, b.updated_at
     FROM rate_limit_buckets b
     JOIN api_keys k ON b.key = 'ingest:key:' || k.id::text
    ORDER BY b.tokens ASC LIMIT 10"
```

A bucket refills at 50 tokens a second, so look at rows with a recent `updated_at`. The table is unlogged and pruned by the worker, so old rows disappear.

## 2. Fix 429s

429 is the system protecting the database. The remedy is on the sending side, because the limit is per key and per request:

1. **Send bigger batches, less often.** The same spans in fewer requests. Up to 1000 spans and 5 MiB per request.
2. **Give each producer its own key.** Limits are per key, so one noisy service no longer throttles another. Create one key per service or environment in the dashboard's **API keys** page (see [revoke-key.md](revoke-key.md#revoke-a-project-api-key) for where it is).
3. **Let the SDK retry.** It waits as long as `Retry-After` says, then retries, so short bursts are absorbed. Only a sustained overload drops batches.
4. **Raise the limit only with a code change.** If your real, steady traffic is above 50 requests per second per key after batching, change `INGEST_LIMITER` in `backend/app/core/ratelimit.py`, then ship it through [deploy.md](deploy.md) after checking the connection budget in [scale.md](scale.md#2-the-connection-budget).

Verify: the 429 rate returns to roughly zero, `spanlight_ingested_spans_total` keeps rising, and new spans show up in the dashboard.

## 3. If the load is on the database

A burst that stays under the limit can still be heavy: many keys, or many large batches.

1. Check the database as in [scale.md](scale.md#1-find-the-bottleneck): connections, running statements and CPU.
2. If connections are the limit, check `spanlight_rate_limit_unavailable_total` and the `rate_limit_unavailable` log lines. They mean the rate-limit pool was exhausted and the limit was skipped for those requests.
3. Add capacity: [scale.md](scale.md).
4. The worker keeps going during a spike. Rollups recompute every 5 minutes, so charts over windows longer than 24 hours can lag by up to that long; windows of 24 hours or less read the raw spans and are current.

Replaying a batch is safe. Ingestion is idempotent: spans are upserted on their natural key and trace totals are recomputed from the stored spans, so a sender that retries after a 429 or a timeout does not double-count.

## 4. Late spans: rebuild the rollups

### When to use

Spans arrived more than 48 hours after they started. Typical causes: a sender buffered while offline and flushed days later, a collector replayed a backlog, or a project was imported. The trace explorer shows these spans (it reads raw spans), but charts over windows longer than 24 hours (they read the hourly rollups, and say `approximate`) are missing them, because the scheduled job only recomputes the last 48 hours.

### Find the affected range

Spans ingested in the last day whose start was more than 48 hours before they arrived, per project:

```bash
spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c \
  "SELECT project_id, min(started_at) AS earliest, max(started_at) AS latest, count(*) AS spans
     FROM spans
    WHERE ingested_at > now() - interval '1 day'
      AND started_at < ingested_at - interval '48 hours'
    GROUP BY project_id"
```

Run it as the database owner (as here): the app role sees only the project bound to its session, because of row-level security. Each row gives you a project id and the time range to rebuild. Widen the range by a day on each side if you are unsure. (A span that a sender re-sends has its `ingested_at` refreshed, so a replay of old data shows up here too.)

### Rebuild

```bash
spl exec worker spanlight rollups backfill \
  --project 0198f3a2-5c1e-7b3a-9d41-6f2e8a1c0b77 \
  --from 2026-09-20 --to 2026-10-02
```

Expected: `Wrote 412 rollup rows.` (your own count).

How it behaves:

- `--from` is inclusive and `--to` is exclusive. Both are ISO 8601; a value without a UTC offset is read as UTC (`2026-09-20` is midnight UTC). Both ends are widened to whole hours.
- The range may be at most 90 days. Split larger ranges into several runs.
- It works in day-sized chunks, newest first, and commits each chunk, so stopping it halfway keeps what was written. Run the same command again to finish.
- Recomputing is idempotent: running it twice gives the same rows.
- It is not bound by the worker's 50-second task limit, and each chunk is its own transaction, so it can run while the system is serving traffic.

Errors you may see:

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `no project with id <id>` | The project id does not exist. Check `SELECT id, name FROM projects`. |
| `--from must be earlier than --to` | The range is empty or reversed. |
| `the range may not be longer than 90 days` | Split the range. |
| `'<value>' is not an ISO 8601 date` | Use `2026-09-20` or `2026-09-20T13:00:00+00:00`. |

### Verify

Open the project's overview with a window longer than 24 hours (for example 30 days) and check that the span count for the affected days matches the trace explorer. Or compare in SQL, as the owner:

```bash
spl exec postgres psql -U postgres -d spanlight -c \
  "SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM spans
            WHERE project_id = '0198f3a2-5c1e-7b3a-9d41-6f2e8a1c0b77'
              AND started_at >= '2026-09-20' AND started_at < '2026-10-02') AS raw_spans,
          (SELECT coalesce(sum(span_count), 0) FROM span_rollups_hourly
            WHERE project_id = '0198f3a2-5c1e-7b3a-9d41-6f2e8a1c0b77'
              AND bucket_start >= '2026-09-20' AND bucket_start < '2026-10-02') AS rolled_up"
```

The two numbers should match.

### Escape hatch

Rollups are derived data and can be rebuilt at any time from the spans, so there is nothing to undo. If a backfill is interrupted, run it again. If spans are older than the project's retention, they have been deleted and cannot be rebuilt (a backup is the only copy: [restore.md](restore.md)).
