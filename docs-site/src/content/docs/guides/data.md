How Spanlight treats your data at scale and how to operate it. Settings are listed in [Configuration](/docs/configuration/), and step-by-step procedures are in the [runbooks](/docs/runbooks/).

## Metrics over long windows are approximate

The overview, time series and per-model views aggregate spans.

- A window of **24 hours or less** reads the spans themselves, and percentiles are exact.
- A window **longer than 24 hours** reads hourly rollups: one row per project, hour, environment, provider, model and span kind, with counts, tokens, cost and a bucketed histogram of latencies. This keeps a 30-day chart fast with millions of spans. The API marks these responses `"approximate": true` and the dashboard says so.

A rollup-backed read widens the window to whole UTC hours, so its first and last hour count in full. Counts, errors, tokens and cost can therefore include up to about an hour of spans before the start of the range (and the comparison with the previous period is widened the same way). On top of that, latency percentiles are estimated: each histogram bucket is about 1.5 times wider than the one before, so an estimate can be off by roughly 25 %, and a latency above 300 seconds is reported as 300 seconds. Cost stays unknown, never zero, when no call in the group has a known price; `GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/unpriced-models` shows which models in your traffic are missing from the price table.

The worker refreshes the last 48 hours of rollups every five minutes. A window over 24 hours can therefore lag by up to five minutes, and a span that arrives more than 48 hours after it started is not reflected until the range is backfilled by hand with `spanlight rollups backfill --project <project id> --from <date> --to <date>` (at most 90 days at a time). The rollups are derived data and can always be rebuilt from the spans.

## Rate limits

Three things are limited, with a token bucket per caller kept in Postgres:

| What | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Ingestion, per API key | 50 requests a second, bursts of 100 |
| Reads with an API key or a personal access token, per credential | 20 requests a second, bursts of 40 |
| Starting a demo session, per client address | 10 an hour |

A limited request gets `429 RATE_LIMITED` and a `Retry-After` header in whole seconds. The Python SDK retries `429` and honours `Retry-After`. If you send traces yourself, prefer fewer, larger batches over many small ones.

Because the buckets are in Postgres, the limits hold across any number of API replicas. If the limiter cannot reach the database, requests are let through and the failure is logged and counted, so a hiccup in the limiter never becomes an ingestion outage.

Sign-in, signup, password reset, verification email and invitation limits count attempts per time window instead. The main ones are listed in [Accounts and sign-in](/docs/guides/accounts/) and all of them in the [API conventions](/docs/api/conventions/). Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` so that limits and session records see the real client address; see [Self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting/).

## Exports

Start an export from the **Traces** page: it exports the traces that match the filters you have set, as CSV (one row per trace) or JSONL (one trace per line, with its spans). Follow it and download the file in **Settings, Project, Exports**. Exports need object storage, and the file is kept in your own bucket.

- A time range is required and can span at most 90 days. More than 100 000 matching traces fail the export as too large; narrow the range.
- Members, admins and owners can export. Viewers cannot.
- The export runs in the background. When it is done, the dashboard offers a download link that is valid for one hour; open the export again for a fresh one.
- Files are deleted seven days after they are made, and when the project is deleted.
- Spreadsheet cells that begin with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are prefixed with an apostrophe, so opening the file cannot run a formula.

Requesting an export (`POST /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/exports`) accepts an `Idempotency-Key` header, so a retried request runs once and returns the same export. Use a fresh random key, such as a UUID, for each intended export. A key belongs to the caller that sent it (a user, or an API key), is remembered for 24 hours, and the same key with a different body is `422 IDEMPOTENCY_MISMATCH`. A `409 NOT_CONFIGURED` is remembered too, so after switching object storage on, retry with a new key. Other routes ignore the header.

The audit log has its own CSV download in **Settings, Organization, Audit log**. The filters you set apply, and up to 50 000 events fit in one file.

## Backups and restore

With object storage, `BACKUP_DATABASE_URL` and `BACKUPS_ENABLED` (on by default), the worker runs `pg_dump` once a day, from 03:00 UTC, and uploads the dump to your bucket. It keeps the newest backup of each of the last 14 days and of the last 8 Sundays. Without them the nightly job ends as `skipped_not_configured` and takes no backup, so confirm the prerequisites in the runbook before relying on it.

`BACKUP_DATABASE_URL` must name a role that can bypass row-level security. The application role cannot dump the tenant tables, so using it makes the dump fail instead of producing an incomplete one.

A restore always goes into a new, empty database, with `spanlight restore`, and refuses a database that already has tables. [Restoring a database backup](/docs/runbooks/restore/) has every command. Rehearse a restore at least once: a backup you have never restored is a hope, not a backup.

## Watching Spanlight itself

- **Health.** `/health/live` says the process is up. `/health/ready` also checks the database and the migrations, and the worker heartbeat while `WORKER_REQUIRED` is true (the default). It answers `503` when one of them is wrong, and also when more than 1000 notifications are overdue by over ten minutes.
- **Metrics.** With `METRICS_TOKEN` set, the API serves Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`, and the worker does the same on `WORKER_METRICS_PORT`. They cover requests and latency, ingested and rejected spans, rate-limit rejections, idempotency outcomes, finished jobs, pending notifications and rollup duration. The [service level objectives](/docs/runbooks/slo/) page has alert rules built on them.
- **Self-tracing.** Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to send OpenTelemetry spans about Spanlight's own requests and queries to a collector. Request bodies, headers and query parameters are never recorded.
- **Errors and logs.** `SENTRY_DSN` reports errors without request bodies, cookies or query strings. Logs are JSON lines by default (`LOG_JSON`, `LOG_LEVEL`), and each carries the request ID that the `X-Request-ID` response header returns.

## Load tests and performance targets

The latency objectives are in the [service level objectives](/docs/runbooks/slo/): a p95 of at most 200 ms for ingestion and at most 300 ms for the dashboard. The load tests hold Spanlight to them under load: ingestion of 500 spans a second, and the dashboard overview and the trace list at 20 requests a second each, with 10 million spans stored.

They are checked with [k6](https://k6.io) scripts against the shipped Docker Compose stack, so you can repeat the measurement on your own hardware. The scripts, the seeder that fills the database with a 28-day history, and the instructions are in [`backend/load`](https://github.com/noob-master-cell/spanlight/tree/main/backend/load) in the repository. The **Load test** workflow runs the same scripts on a GitHub-hosted runner: `smoke` (100 000 spans) checks that the setup works, and `full` (10 million spans) takes hours. A script fails when it misses its latency target, when more than 1 % of requests fail, or when it cannot hold the request rate.

Measure before you tune. [Self-hosting](/docs/self-hosting/) lists the four Postgres settings that matter most on a larger host.
