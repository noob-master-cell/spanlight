Spanlight is one Docker image with three roles and Postgres. Postgres is the only datastore, and it also holds the job queue, so there is no Redis or message broker to run.

## What runs

| Service | Role | Listens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres` | PostgreSQL 17. Traces, spans, users, sessions, rollups and the job queue. | 5432, internal |
| `migrate` | Applies the database migrations as the database owner, creates the unprivileged `spanlight_app` role, then exits. | none |
| `api` | The FastAPI application: authentication, ingestion and queries. | 8000, internal |
| `worker` | Background jobs: retention, cleanup, hourly rollups, notifications, backups and exports, demo traffic. | 9100 for `/metrics`, internal |
| `web` | Caddy. Serves the dashboard and this documentation, and proxies `/api`, `/v1` and `/health` to the API. | `WEB_PORT`, 8080 by default |

The API and worker connect as `spanlight_app`, a role that is neither a superuser nor able to bypass row-level security. Row-level security on the trace tables is what keeps one project's data from another's even if a query forgets its filter, so never point `DATABASE_URL` at the database owner.

## Docker Compose

Requirements: Docker with the Compose plugin.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noob-master-cell/spanlight.git
cd spanlight
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env       # fill in POSTGRES_PASSWORD, APP_DB_PASSWORD and SECRET_KEY
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file deploy/.env up -d --build
```

The dashboard is at `http://localhost:8080` (change the port with `WEB_PORT`). Check the stack with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health/ready
```

A healthy instance answers `200` and a body like `{"status":"ok","database":"ok","migrations":"ok","worker_heartbeat_age_s":7.4,"outbox_backlog":0}`: the seconds since a worker last reported, and the number of notifications waiting to be sent. `/health/ready` answers `503` when the database is unreachable, when the schema is not the one this build expects, when no worker has reported in the last two minutes (unless `WORKER_REQUIRED=false`), or when more than 1000 notifications are overdue by over ten minutes.

Spanlight does not terminate TLS. Put your own reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the `web` service, set `APP_BASE_URL` to the public `https://` URL, and set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the proxy's address ranges so rate limits and session records see real client addresses. With an `https` base URL cookies become `Secure` and the application refuses to start with the default `SECRET_KEY`.

### Optional add-ons

Each is switched on by its own variables; see [Configuration](/docs/configuration/) for all of them.

- **Email** (address verification and password reset): set `EMAIL_PROVIDER` to `resend` or `smtp` and the values it needs.
- **Sign in with GitHub and Google**: set the client ID and secret of a provider, and register `<APP_BASE_URL>/api/v1/auth/oauth/<provider>/callback` as its callback URL.
- **Two-factor authentication**: set `CREDENTIALS_KEYS`, and back its value up. Without it, authenticator enrolment answers `409 NOT_CONFIGURED`.
- **Object storage, backups and exports**: set `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `S3_SECRET_KEY` (and `S3_ENDPOINT` for a store other than AWS). Nightly backups additionally need `BACKUP_DATABASE_URL`. To try this locally without a cloud account, add the MinIO file: `docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml -f deploy/compose.minio.yaml --env-file deploy/.env up -d --build`. Export downloads are links straight to the store, so the public S3 endpoint (`S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`, or `S3_ENDPOINT` when that is unset) must use https when the dashboard is served over https; otherwise browsers block the download as mixed content.
- **More than one API replica**: rate limits and idempotency state live in Postgres, so replicas share them. `deploy/compose.replicas.yaml` is an example that runs two.
- **Metrics**: set `METRICS_TOKEN` and scrape `api:8000/metrics` and `worker:9100/metrics` on the internal network with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. `deploy/prometheus.yml` is an example scrape configuration. `/metrics` is not served through the web port.
- **Error reporting and self-tracing**: `SENTRY_DSN`, and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` for OpenTelemetry spans about Spanlight's own requests and queries.

## Tuning Postgres

The Compose file runs Postgres 17 with its stock settings, except `jit=off`: JIT compilation takes longer than the dashboard and rollup queries it is meant to speed up. Stock settings assume a small machine, so on a host with several gigabytes of memory and tens of millions of spans these four are worth a look. Spanlight does not set them, because the right values depend on your hardware and on what else runs on it.

| Setting | Default | Why it matters here | A starting point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shared_buffers` | `128MB` | Postgres' own page cache. The dashboard reads windows of recent spans, and a cache this small is churned by every other query. | About 25 % of the memory you give Postgres. The operating system caches the rest. |
| `effective_cache_size` | `4GB` | Allocates nothing. It tells the planner how much data is probably cached (this plus the operating system's cache), and the planner chooses index scans over table scans more readily when the data fits. | 50 to 75 % of the memory you give Postgres. |
| `work_mem` | `4MB` | Memory for one sort or hash. The latency percentiles sort every model call in the window, and larger windows spill to disk at the default. | 16 to 32 MB. It is used per sort or hash, per query, so many connections multiply it: keep connections times a few times `work_mem` well inside your memory. |
| `random_page_cost` | `4` | The planner's cost of a random page read, against `1` for a sequential one. The default describes a spinning disk. | `1.1` on SSD or NVMe, which makes index scans look as cheap as they are. |

To change them, extend the `command` of the `postgres` service in an override file, and keep `jit=off`, because an override replaces the whole `command`:

```yaml
# deploy/compose.tuning.yaml
services:
  postgres:
    command:
      - postgres
      - -c
      - jit=off
      - -c
      - shared_buffers=2GB
      - -c
      - effective_cache_size=6GB
      - -c
      - work_mem=16MB
      - -c
      - random_page_cost=1.1
```

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml -f deploy/compose.tuning.yaml --env-file deploy/.env up -d postgres
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml -f deploy/compose.tuning.yaml --env-file deploy/.env exec postgres \
  psql -U postgres -tAc "SHOW shared_buffers"
```

Changing `shared_buffers` restarts Postgres, so expect a short outage. The values above suit a host with about 8 GB for Postgres; scale them to yours. On a managed Postgres, set the same parameters in the provider's console.

## Railway

The public demo runs on Railway: Railway Postgres plus three services built from the same Dockerfile. The [Railway guide](/docs/deploy/railway/) walks through it step by step, including the secrets and the infrastructure-as-code file in `deploy/railway/`.

## Upgrading and operating

Back up before every upgrade. The [runbooks](/docs/runbooks/) cover each procedure with the commands and the output to expect:

- [Deploy a new version](/docs/runbooks/deploy/) and [roll it back](/docs/runbooks/rollback/)
- [Restore a database backup](/docs/runbooks/restore/)
- [Rotate secrets](/docs/runbooks/rotate-secrets/) and [revoke a key](/docs/runbooks/revoke-key/)
- [Scale](/docs/runbooks/scale/) and handle an [ingestion spike](/docs/runbooks/ingestion-spike/)
- [Service level objectives and alerts](/docs/runbooks/slo/)

## Admin commands

The `spanlight` command inside the `api` container is the operator's tool:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file deploy/.env exec api spanlight --help
```

It creates users (`create-user`), resets passwords (`reset-password`) and two-factor authentication (`reset-2fa`), refreshes the price table (`sync-prices`), runs migrations (`migrate`), and restores a backup (`restore`; see the [restore runbook](/docs/runbooks/restore/)).
